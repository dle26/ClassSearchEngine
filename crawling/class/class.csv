ENTP,308,Business Model Design and Innovation,3,"This course takes the perspective of entrepreneurs or business unit managers. The three basic questions that all entrepreneurs and intrepreneurs must answer is where to play, how to win and what to do.  You have identified a group of customers for your product or service (where to play).  Your first challenge is to know what features (Customer Attributes) your target customer will pay for. Innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call Focal Attributes. Your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  The concept called Profit Objectives (similar but not the same as KPI and/or SMART objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   Your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  At this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives. You will learn how to illustrate this alignment through a mapping process.

FSNA,123,"The Automobile: Its Origins, Development, and Impact on American Society",4,"The automobile is without doubt one of the defining influences on American life and society.  In 1900, most people lived in rural communities, and the main forms of personal transportation were walking and the horse and buggy.  Half a century later, most Americans lived in cities or suburbs, there were millions of cars in garages, and roads and highways criss-crossed the nation.  The car has transformed where we live and work, how we play, and the very nature of our cities.
This course will examine the American automobile from several perspectives: its origins, evolution and effect on industry; its impact on American life and leisure; and the automobile as an art form and American icon.  We will also discuss how we preserve examples of our automotive heritage.  These topics will be explored in the context of the usual writing and discussion components of a first SAGES course."
FSNA,124,The Challenge of Sustainability,4,"This four-credit-hour course provides an introduction to collegiate writing and to various dimensions of academic life, but will focus on the critical appreciation of the challenges we face in transitioning--or failing to transition--to a sustainable society.  Climate change, along with increased development and population, are altering the natural environment we live in and rely on.  This course will review some of the current and future impacts of these changes, and explore alternate paths forward and how they might be forged.  The class will involve both literacy and numeracy, and students will learn to become comfortable handling some of the quantitative measures relevant to sustainability issues.

FSNA,129,Engineering Design to Alleviate Extreme Poverty,4,"Almost half (47%) of the people in Africa have incomes less than $1.25 per day. Most of these people live as subsistence farmers in small villages with no electricity, running water or automobiles (but with cell phones). Through readings, group discussions, writing assignments, and open-ended experiential learning activities, the course will address ways that engineering solutions can improve peoples' lives within these severe economic constraints. A hands-on component of the course will involve designing and building affordable devices to meet specific needs. We have developed interactions with villages in Senegal, Malawi, and Botswana, and the engineering solutions will be explored within the context of these villages."
FSNA,133,Engineering Innovation and Design,4,"Innovation and design are cornerstones of the engineering profession and are responsible for many of the improvements in the quality of life that have taken place over the last century. Innovation is also viewed as the essential skill that will drive economies and solve many of the challenges facing societies around the globe. This seminar-based course will provide a disciplined approach to engineering innovation and design. The course requires students to engage in written and oral communications as well as working in small teams to complete open-ended design/build-related assignments. The course will culminate in the design, fabrication and validation of a prototype product to meet an identified need. The design, fabrication and validation of these products will be carried out in think[box] 1.0 (Prentke-Romich Collaboratory), and the Reinberger Design Studio."
FSNA,134,Fuel Cells,4,"Fuel Cells convert hydrogen and other fuels directly to electricity and are viewed as a key technology for non-polluting, oil-independent energy in the future.  In this course, we will study and critically analyze the prospects, technical and economic barriers, and impact of broad implementation of fuel cells, focusing on the transportation sector and portable power.  Major topics of the course include: (i) World and US energy outlook; (ii) Potential role and impact of fuel-cells; their advantages, principles of operation, design and materials issues, limitations and prospects for improvements; (iii) Special focus on details of a polymer type fuel cells (PEMFCs) for transportation and portable power; (iv) Modeling fuel cell performance and evaluation of controlling mechanisms that limit performance.  The course is designed for students from all disciplines.  Students will be expected to read assigned texts and articles and critically analyze statements and points of view presented.  Quantitative analysis will be encouraged and developed.  Student teams will develop a hypothesis to improve fuel cell performance by modifying the design of a component of the fuel cell.  The new component design with then be fabricated and tested in an operating prototype fuel cell.  Data analysis, hypothesis conclusion, and reporting of results are expected."
FSNA,135,BioDesign Basics: The Art of Finding Patient Needs,4,"BioDesign basics explores the art of finding patient needs. No prior clinical or medical education is required, as we focus on acquiring and refining the underpinning critical thinking skills needed to identify and articulate unmet clinical patient needs in contemporary healthcare settings. Many--if not a majority of--ideas leading to healthcare innovation are derived from issues that arise during the daily activities of caring for patients. Whether it is frustration with the use of a specific surgical instrument, processes that interfere with health care delivery, better waiting rooms for the family, designing more comfortable hospital gowns, or materials inadequate for intended outcomes, patient needs cover a broad range of physical and emotional states. Many students find the idea of identifying a ""patient need"" quite ambiguous at first, but the BioDesign process for defining patient need is a widely use national model developed at Stanford University that the student will find contains easy-to-follow steps that are simple and appealing.
As an interactive and ""hands-on"" course, students will be engaged in discussions, events and activities to promote a first-hand understanding of ""needs finding"" to support individual mastery of writing and oral presentation skills. The Fourth Hour will be centered on ""walking tours"" of local medical institutions around University Circle as well as actual use of medical devices (wheelchairs and crutches) on campus as ways to help your efforts identify a patient need based on those observations. In short, you will create your own experiences leading to stories that make writing fun. The course requires students to engage in written and oral communications as well as working in small teams to complete open-ended assignments."
FSNA,136,"Saving the World from Poverty, Disease, Injustice and Environmental Exploitation",4,"Half of the world's population lives in poverty.  The causes of poverty and injustice are complex and the ramifications are numerous and serious and include grave risk to human health and to the environment.  Through reading, analysis, writing, and rigorous discussion the class will investigate issues surrounding poverty and disparities in health and opportunity.  We will also explore how innovation and engineering design can help address causes of poverty and disparity and meet needs of people at risk.  Design teams will work throughout the semester to identify an unmet need to engineer a solution to benefit an under-served or under-resourced population.  Fourth-hour activities will include interviewing knowledgeable stakeholders (locally and abroad via teleconference), learning about and volunteering with service organizations, and visiting local institutions and/or companies addressing these issues."
FSNA,138,Light,4,"This course explores Light, otherwise known as visible electromagnetic radiation.  We will examine what light is in its various forms; how it is created and detected; how we perceive it; and how it has influenced our evolutionary development, our technological, artistic, and religious cultures, and our conceptions of space and time.  Students will discuss topics suggested by the course readings and by exposure to the many scientific activities, historical artifacts, and artistic works on the CWRU campus and at other local institutions that involve light in a significant way."
FSNA,144,Is Mind What the Brain Does?,4,"Together we will explore the nature of the human mind by asking the question, ""Is the mind what the brain does?""  Through an exploration of neurological and psychological case studies, empirical research studies, direct experimentation, and readings and films about brain structure and function, we will form hypotheses about the relationship between the mind and the brain and gather evidence to test our hypotheses.  Writing assignments will explore ideas about your own mind and brain, examples of other individuals with unusual or atypical brains and minds, and a research topic of your choice."
FSNA,145,Hostile Water,4,"Water is an essential, valuable resource that is protected by a wide variety of social, legal, and technical institutions.  However, not all water is desirable. Hostile water is unwanted water from which we seek to protect ourselves. Hostile waters challenge our understanding of the natural world and the social doctrine upon which our understanding is based. This course will examine how historical ""hostile water"" events have altered our social perceptions and legal institutions, led to structural flood control, ""damn"" engineering, the National Flood Insurance Program, Landsat satellites, ""Wild Rivers,"" FEMA, wetlands preservation, detention basins, etc., and to homeowner stormwater management options such as rain barrels and rain gardens. The course will begin with a review of the original documentation and modern interpretation of the Johnstown Flood. Students will then conduct research on historical events and prepare written briefing documents and oral presentations focusing on the physical impacts and social consequences of dramatic hostile water events. The course will end with a critical review of the Hurricane Katrina event. Class discussions will examine how hostile water events have impacted U.S. policies and institutions, and appears to be leading to stormwater management obligations for individual homeowners."
FSNA,148,Science or Pseudoscience? Exploring Extraordinary Claims,4,"In the contemporary world, extraordinary claims about ghosts, aliens, and the nature of the universe appear on popular television shows, on the Internet, and in the press.  Many of these claims are framed as science.  In this seminar, we critically examine the nature of these understandings of the world around us.  We will ask if these claims are scientific and, if not, whether they constitute a form of pseudoscience.  We will explore the role of demarcation, evidence, scientific progress, and fallacies of reasoning in pseudoscience.  We will also consider the historical and sociocultural currents that give rise to these pseudoscientific claims as well as their social and political implications.  Drawing on anthropological, philosophical, and historical case studies, we will consider topics such as cryptozoology, astrology, ancient aliens, parapsychology, the Nemesis theory of dinosaur extinctions, theories of intelligence, and other extraordinary claims."
FSNA,150,Hobbies - Engineering fun,4,"This seminar introduces students to the idea that engineering can be found in all sorts of unexpected places, even in our hobbies.  To test our hypothesis, we will examine the hobbies enjoyed by the course instructors:  baseball and building synthetic coral reef aquariums.  Students will then work under the instructors' guidance to analyze how principles of engineering can be used to understand the successes and failures they have encountered in their own hobbies, with the ultimate goal of developing a proposal for improving their experience of these hobbies."
FSNA,154,The Green Energy Transformation in Germany,4,"This seminar introduces students to the development and successes of green technologies in Germany.  We will examine the proactive development of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies, commonly referred to as Energiewende, that was started by the German Green movement and promoted by Germany's innovative renewable energy policies.  We will consider such questions as: What are the implications of this German success story, both for the US and the rest of the world?  What lessons can be applied to other situations?  What factors might limit the utility of those lessons?  In the process of our investigation, we will examine such important issues as globalization, resource finiteness, and sustainability challenges, including economic crises, climate change, energy insecurity, and global competition."
FSNA,157,Plastics Recycling: Re-use of Plastic Waste,4,"About 300 million tons of plastics are produced globally each year, but only about 10 percent of these products are recycled, despite the fact that recycling uses significantly less energy and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than does manufacture of the virgin materials. This course will address the scientific, economic, environmental, and political issues involved in plastics recycling. Following an introduction to the chemical structures and properties of commodity plastics, we will discuss the actual recycling of plastics in municipal waste including the problems faced in collection and sorting of plastic waste and recycling economics. Then we will address the commercial applications and properties of recycled plastics and why they generally have inferior properties to virgin materials, which significantly reduces their market value. Finally we will look at biodegradable alternatives to oil-based materials as  well as some options to plastics recycling, including land filling, burning for power generation, and monomer reclamation."

The professor will choose the first three global developments to be investigated as well as the relevant readings.  His topics will most likely be the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the rise of China as a great power and the fiftieth anniversary of the European Union.  Each of the remaining seven will be chosen by small groups of students, who will assign the readings and run the sessions for their respective topic.  Possible topics include the global food crisis, genocide and the failure of the world community to stop it, global warming and the growing gap between the world's rich and poor."
FSSO,126,Religion and the Ethics of War,4,"Although war is a highly rational, organized and purposeful affair, it also is the most destructive and bloody of human activities.  For this reason, war and warfare has always been subject to various religious and moral restrictions.  As technology has developed, the conduct of war has changed and the definitions of just and unjust war, as well as what it means to fight justly, have undergone profound changes.  This course looks at war and warfare from a variety of angles and examines how various religious and moral thinkers have tried to define just war, and create guidelines for fighting a war justly.  At the end of the semester, the course looks at the moral challenges presented by new technologies and new concepts of war."
FSSO,128,Movers and Shakers: Leadership,4,"""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has"" (Margaret Mead, 1901-1978).  This seminar is about understanding what enables people to make a generative impact on the world.  Students will explore the socio-emotional and motivational characteristics of effective leaders and their ability to create positive change.  Students will also be encouraged to develop their own theories of leadership and to explore their personal approaches to making a difference.  The seminar will profile leaders from different occupations and walks of life.  Seminar sessions will feature assigned readings on leaders and change agents, class discussion on what drives movers and shakers, and individual and group presentations on class members' emergent leadership perspectives.

A key objective of the seminar is the development of critical thinking skills, writing skills, and verbal skills.  Consequently, the weekly class readings, reflection papers on class readings, class discussions, class presentations (individual and group), and final project are vital features of the seminar experience.  Students will be expected to leave the seminar with a grounded perspective on leaders and leadership, and the ability to articulate their own personal views on making a difference in the world."
FSSO,136,The Founding Fathers,4,"Americans often disparage politicians and U.S. political institutions, like Congress and the Presidency.  Nonetheless, the same Americans often revere the men and women who founded the country and designed the political system that seems to give us so much trouble.  This four credit-hour course explores American political thought from our country's founding to the present through the prism of the founding fathers.  It will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry into all of the contradictions inherent in the writings and lives of  the founding fathers and contemporary American politics, guided by reading from primary as well as secondary sources."
FSSO,140,Working-Class Literature,4,"In her volume, Silences (1978), writer Tillie Olson refers to the relationship between social class and literature as ""the great unexamined."" This statement still largely rings true, despite the continued production of novels, films, and poems depicting the working-class, and despite the unprecedented growth in recent years of America's working class.  In this course, we will examine the relationship between social class and literature, reading narratives written by and about laborers in the hopes of understanding the complexities of working-class life in America, including the intricate ways in which economic status mediates one's sense of identity. Beginning our study with mid-to-late nineteenth-century works, we will consider ideas about economics, race, and gender that have shaped and that continue to influence the depiction of the working-class.  Throughout the course, we will pair literary and historical readings with pop-cultural materials, viewing films, listening to music, and analyzing visual arts both in class and on visits to Cleveland cultural institutions such as the Western Reserve Historical Society and the Maltz Museum of Jewish History."
FSSO,143,Living With and Making Decisions Concerning Injustice,4,"Injustice. What do you think of when you hear that word? There are all types of injustice in this world, and chances are that during our lifetime we will either find ourselves in a position or system of power, perpetrating injustice on others; or in a position or system of supposed impotence, a subject of injustice. What are our choices? How will we respond? In this course we will examine the topic of living with and making decisions concerning injustice using, as an example, the specific injustice of slavery, examining the lives and decisions of both a famous slaveholder and two not-so-famous slaves; and learning from their lives and decisions how we might, ourselves, live with and make decisions concerning injustices we face in our lives."
FSSO,145,"Berlin in History, History in Berlin",4,"From its emergence as a fishing village in the sandy marshes of the eastern frontier of Germany, to its 21st-century role as a cosmopolitan metropolis, Berlin has embodied the arc of change over time in human society. This course uses the history of the city of Berlin as the lens through which to contemplate the complexity of human social and cultural arrangements, their expression in economics and politics (including war), and the imbrication of human cultural and social constructions with the ""natural"" world.

We will read books and articles about the history, culture, economy, and politics of Berlin, primarily from its establishment as the capital of new German Empire in 1871 to the present. We will view films that introduce us to the manic energy that Berlin represented in the transition to modernity. We will visit local museums that house examples of the material culture of Berlin, from the Cleveland Museum of Art to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. We will listen to the music of Berlin, from the baroque of the Brandenburg Concertos to the heavy metal of the Skorpions. And we will learn its history, from fishing village, to court city, to imperial metropolis and industrial engine, to divided symbol of the Cold War, to de-industrialized center of art, government, education, and incubator of high-technology.

This First Seminar will prepare students to pursue their undergraduate degrees grounded in thinking about places in time, about change over time, and about human creativity, while preparing them to write and speak about their arguments with clarity and grace."
FSSO,146,"The Past and Future of Art, Architecture and Museums in Cleveland",4,"During the gilded age, Cleveland became one of this country's most powerful centers of business, industry, and political power.  For example, John D. Rockefeller, who started his business career in Cleveland, became the wealthiest individual in human history, and Mark Hanna, the leader of Cleveland's Republican political machine, selected and engineered the election of eight Ohio-born Presidents of the United States, setting a state record which is still unbroken.  As late as the 1930s, Henry Luce located the headquarters of Time, Life and Fortune magazines in Cleveland; and the Terminal Tower, the nexus of the vast, sprawling railroad and real-estate Empire of the Van Sweringen Brothers, was the country's highest building outside of New York.  This class will examine one of the by-products of this accumulation of power and money: the flowering of art and culture in Cleveland during the early 20th century, and the creation of notable cultural institutions, such as one of this country's finest symphony orchestras, one of its top ten art museums, a major university, and an array of other notable entities, many of them housed in buildings of architectural distinction.  The class will also examine the economic, cultural and intellectual decline of Cleveland in the second half of the 20th century, and recent attempts to reverse this trend through intensive efforts to revitalize University Circle.  In addition to classroom sessions, the course will include field trips to the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Western Reserve Historical Society, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, and an architectural tour of downtown Cleveland.  The class will be centered on three interrelated questions: What makes a great city?  How can the artistic and cultural life of a great city be developed and sustained?  How can the social and economic collapse of a great city be reversed?"
FSSO,147,Critical Attitude,4,"In his essay, ""What is Enlightenment?"" Immanuel Kant said enlightenment begins with the courage to use your own understanding -as opposed to following the mindset of your parents, teachers, or ministers. Two hundred years later, the great French social historian Michel Foucault called the Kantian idea of enlightenment, ""critique."" For Foucault, the essential is a critical attitude.  In this seminar, we pursue the thread of a critical attitude focusing on three areas of your life: culture, work, and school.  For reasons we will see, politics will remain in the background, as the un-broached dimension.  The month on culture is called ""osmosis,"" the month on work ""treadmill"" and the month on school ""brainwash.""  In this dark(ly humorous) course, we join selected readings in the tradition of critical theory with contemporary and classic films.  And we visit local cultural institutions, and events -as well as riding through the city with a critical attitude."
FSSO,149,"Creativity in the Arts, Sciences, and Engineering",4,"This seminar will have a focus on creativity in the arts, sciences, and engineering.  What are the similarities and differences in the creative process in these three different broad fields?  How are the creative products different?  What are the creative processes involved in these different domains.  Are there differences in personalities between scientists and artists?  How can we foster creativity in children and adults in these fields?  We all read about and discuss the different dimensions of creativity; what makes something creative; what helps people become creative; the role of cognition and emotion in the creative process in the arts and sciences; and mental illness and creativity."
FSSO,151,"Border Crossings: Travel, Culture, and Identity",4,"This seminar will explore the transformative nature of travel, especially in regard to individual and cultural identity.  Through seminar discussions, extensive writing and revision, and formal oral presentations, our class will explore how individuals, including ourselves, define themselves in personal, local, and national contexts and how we redefine ourselves and our world as we cross geographical borders.  Course texts will include works of fiction, non-fiction travel narratives, films, and scholarly essays that will compel us to question our everyday world and consider matters of cultural exchange and social belonging."
FSSO,152,Decision Making in Everyday Life,4,"Although social cognition allows us to process vast amounts of information quickly, we are not always aware of the subtle forces that guide our decision making.  This course will use a seminar approach to explore rational and irrational forces that influence decision making.  We will use a multi-disciplinary approach to decision making, including topics such as personality factors, incentive-based decision making, cognitive biases, automatic information processing, and theories of mind.  These topics will be explored using class discussion, writings, and student presentations."
FSSO,153,Reading Social Justice: The Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards,4,"In this seminar, we will read a selection of poetry, short stories and books and use them as a framework to explore questions related to understanding tolerance, social justice and diversity.  We will begin by establishing a definition of and methodology for addressing these issues in our discussion and writing, and build upon them as the semester progresses.  Much of the fiction and nonfiction we will read will be by winners of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.  In addition to our reading, we will also analyze and discuss a selection of films, art works and music related to our theme.  Our Fourth Hour experiences will include attending the Awards ceremony in September, visits to cultural institutions within University Circle, lectures and guest speakers.  While the primary goal of the class is to help students develop their critical thinking and writing skills, it is also intended to introduce them to a vital, Cleveland-based literary institution.  By engaging the themes, texts, and authors of Anisfield-Wolf, students will have a deeper understanding not only of contemporary literature, but the importance of social justice to a liberal arts education."
FSSO,157,Being in Touch: Animal and Human Considerations,4,"This is a seminar designed to refine skills of critical thinking and reading, listening, learning. writing and verbal presentation while considering the topic of touch.  We will consider touch in different situations and for different purposes - touch in child development, touch in socialization, therapeutic animal touch, touch and violence/harassment, touch in the workplace, touch and technology, taste as a function of touch, healing touch comforting and noxious touch, and things we are afraid to touch."
FSSO,158,The Symphony Orchestra-Cultural Treasure or Outmoded Symbol?,4,"In measuring the cultural profile of a metropolitan area, the presence of a successful symphony orchestra is often used as a model to determine culture sophistication and refinement. In recent years, however, the model of the orchestra has encountered significant challenges. Using the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra as a paradigm, this seminar will examine the role of the orchestra in ascertaining a city's cultural health. Topics of discussion, oral presentations, and writing assignments will address the historical legacy of the classical orchestra; traditional concert-going etiquette and its relevance in 21st-century culture; how orchestras have handled recent financial trials; and defining the importance of the orchestra in today's urban society. Students will have the opportunity to attend orchestral concerts during Fourth Hour, and occasional guests from the Cleveland Orchestra and other University Circle institutions will provide a direct cultural perspective."
FSSO,160,Brazil Inside and Out,4,"In this seminar we will engage in the exploration of Brazil's history, society, and culture from a multidisciplinary and comparative perspective. Host of the latest Soccer Cup and Summer Olympics, Brazil is one of the largest and most diverse countries in the world, as well as one the largest economies and democracies. Known by its natural beauty and resources, tropical climate, vibrant culture and friendly population, the land of soccer and Carnival is also marked by inequality, poverty, corruption, and violence. Due to this complex, challenging and fascinating profile, Brazil defies easy categorizations and provides a unique context for the development of essential academic skills. Over the course of the semester, you will have the opportunity to read, analyze and discuss relevant academic sources, news articles and audiovisual materials, like music and films; learn and experience first-hand basic aspects of Brazilian language and culture, including food and music; and interact with Brazilian students and faculty on campus."
FSSO,161,The Craft of Cloth: Textile Production Since the Industrial Revolution,4,"What counts as hand made? Since the Industrial Revolution, modes of production have been increasingly mechanized to ensure efficient production involving fewer skilled workers. Opposition to industrialization has existed since the earliest moments of the Revolution, when skilled stocking knitters destroyed stocking frames, a technology meant to replace them by putting the ability to create stockings in the hands of unskilled laborers. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a hyper-technological age, but with an increasingly vocal artisanal subculture valorizing the artist or craftsperson who creates unique goods by hand. Our class will explore the tensions and sympathies between industry and craft, the machine and the hand, technology and the imagination. We will focus our inquiry on the production of cloth, since it was the need to produce cloth more efficiently that motivated the Industrial Revolution's earliest technological innovations. We will consider the human relationships and institutions that support the production of textiles and cloth (especially silk and cotton) and which, in turn, create global and local economies that influence social organization. This seminar will be discussion based and writing intensive, and will include field trips to a local clothing factory and to the art museum to see and analyze historic fabrics. We will also speak with local fashion and textile designers. Students will experiment with knitting, weaving, or a cloth craft of their choice in order to participate in the technical--and creative--side of cloth production."
FSSO,164,"Social Change, Genes, and Environment",4,"This seminar will focus on the rapidly expanding understanding of the interaction of biological and social forces--including the interaction of genes and environment.  We will explore claims that are made in science and popular culture about the role of genes in development.  We will focus on the role that social forces play in shaping the effects of genes in development, and health, through epigenetics and related mechanisms.  Adopting a sociology-of-science perspective, we will consider the wider and future implications of gene-environment interactions for politics, the economy, and culture."
FSSO,165,Identities and Social Inequality,4,"In this course, students examine diversity, privilege, and power in US society. Social categories such as gender, heritage, language, race, religion, and sexuality affect the status of both individuals and groups, at times producing unequal distribution of resources and marginalization. No group or individual belongs to one category; therefore, we will also consider how the intersection of these categories produces their own unique effects. Students are expected to analyze and critique social institutions, belief systems, and practices that promote inequality and social justice through data- based dialogue and writing. Modes of inquiry will include quantitative and qualitative research methods and current scholarly literature. This course is conducted in a seminar format that requires students to engage in active, relevant and insightful discussions regarding the course content. Students have the opportunity to hear from guest experts in the field and participate in off-campus learning activities. Reflective and scholarly writing are major components of the course."
FSSO,169,The History of Your Lifetime: Making Sense of the Last Twenty Years,4,"No matter when you grow up, adults make assumptions about what you know, ""You lived through certain events, didn't you? Those events are often very important--the basis of political and policy debates or related to subjects that affect daily life--but it's often difficult to make sense of history you've lived through, but only as children. The usual way we learn about the past--in history classes--isn't very helpful because this is a time period that usually goes beyond what your teachers have been able to cover.

Even if you could have covered this recent time period in history class, unfortunately, most recent subjects haven't received much attention from historians; the archives aren't yet available and we lack much critical distance in making judgments about what is significant and what isn't. We aren't yet sure which assumed causes of historical change are plausible and which only seemed so at the time. This time period usually constitutes most of the student's lifetime--your lifetime.

This class takes these challenges head-on, examining the last 20 years of history. Aside from covering the ""what happened"" for several selected topics, we will attempt to go further and explore how historians think about contemporary events, place current events into longer historical contexts, develop skills in media literacy to better evaluate the quality of information we receive, and discuss the uses and misuses of historical analogies in public debate. We will also investigate the importance of structural narrative in making sense of historical events and processes: what questions do we ask of the past and why those questions and not others? Why do our questions about the past change over time? How do present circumstances affect our historical work? When do we draw our chronological boundaries; when do our stories start and when do they end?"
FSSO,171,Prediction,4,"This course is an interdisciplinary examination of predictions about social events, how we make them, why they go wrong, and how we respond. While some things, like election results, are easy to predict, dramatic events like wars, depressions, and stock market crashes are harder to predict. The course will begin with the basic elements of probability theory to lay the groundwork for the class. Then, we will examine the psychological research on the types of errors people are prone to make regarding probability and the consequences of such biases in perception and estimation. The course will then move on to discuss predicting specific social events, such as elections and stock trends, comparing the empirical research to conventional beliefs. Then the course will address the role of scholarly research more generally, and the empirical work discussing how political scientists, economists, and other scholars often fail to predict the most significant and dramatic events because of their cognitive styles, which vary in the degree to which they rely on simplified models. Finally, the course will discuss how people respond when their predictions go wrong, and their basic tendency to rationalize away errors."
FSSO,172,Islam in South Asia,4,"There are more Muslims in South Asia than in any other region of the world. But within the region, Islam is far from a monolith. What variety of religious practices and traditions of debate have characterized South Asian Muslims? When meshed with different political projects, how do we understand Islam as a deeply contested ideological field? What roles did Muslims play in the history of South Asia? These are some of the questions we will pursue in the seminar. 

The long history of Muslim presence in the region--which now includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan--will offer opportunities for studying them in a wide range of historical contexts: as actors in cosmopolitan, commercial networks of trade; as rulers consolidating states and empires governing large multi-ethnic and multi-religious populations; as ""modernizers"" and ""traditionalists;"" as religious minorities and majorities in different nation-states. Additionally, this seminar will explore Islam in an array of modern settings: from a nation-state created as a ""Muslim homeland"" to a rejection of religion as an adequate basis of national identity; from democracy to military rule; and, from Cold War politics to the ""Global War on Terror."""
FSSO,176,SAVOR:  The Ethics and Politics of Eating,4,"Our food choices affect more than our individual health; what we decide to put into our bodies has important consequences for our environment, the livelihood of farmers, and even the general well-being of a society.  These choices also reveal moral, cultural, and religious values we deem important. In this seminar, we will examine the environmental and social consequences of our food choices by interrogating both our individual habits as well as current (often controversial) food policy issues. In line with the requirements of a SAGES First Seminar, this course is designed to improve students' ability to read critically and interpret moral and political arguments. We will analyze a wide range of writings on food-related issues in order to develop sophisticated perspectives on our food choices. Hopefully, this thoughtful consideration will translate to mindful habits when we convene around food with our friends, families, and communities. Class discussions will be accompanied by class visits to urban gardens, restaurants with a sustainability mission, and farmers' markets. We'll also meet representatives of community organizations like the Greater Cleveland Food Bank."

ESTD,382,"Art, Eco-criticism, and the Environment",3,"As issues of sustainability and environmental impact have become increasingly dominant concerns in contemporary society, eco-criticism has emerged as a vital methodological thread across the humanities.  Motivated by ethical as well as scholarly concerns, eco-criticism not only enacts a fundamental examination of nature as an ideological construct, but also seeks to investigate the complex interrelationship between humanity and the environment.  Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of ""green issues"" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.

ESTD,388,"Politics, Policy, and the Global Environment",3,"This course examines the law, politics and policy surrounding global environmental challenges such as climate change.  The course aims to provide a broad overview of the key concepts, actors, debates, and issues in global environmental politics.  It aims to illustrate the complexities of addressing environmental problems-from the proliferation of global institutions and international actors, to the absence of central enforcement mechanisms.  We examine the causes of environmental degradation and competing views on the gravity of the problem.  Using concepts from political science and economics, we investigate the challenges in getting states to act jointly to address environmental problems.  We examine the actors and institutions of global environmental politics, to understand how conditions are defined as problems and responses are chosen and implemented.  The course concludes by applying the tools and concepts to the case of climate change.

EPOM,410,Intellectual Property Management and Opportunity Assessment,3,"The goal of this course is to address issues relating to the commercialization of scientific inventions by exposing graduate students to the challenges and opportunities encountered when attempting to develop meaningful intellectual property from the point of early discovery to the clinic and market.  Specifically, this course seeks to provide students with the ability to value a given technological advance or invention holistically, focusing on issues that extend beyond scientific efficacy and include patient and practitioner value propositions, legal and intellectual property protection, business modeling, potential market impacts, market competition, and ethical, social, and healthcare practitioner acceptance.

These issues transcend disciplinary boundaries, requiring the integration of expertise in the fields of law, business, and biomedical research disciplines.   For instance, comprehending the intricacies involved in the evolution of an upstream product from the lab to the marketplace requires an understanding of intellectual property management, namely the identification of optimal appropriability mechanisms, constructing an intellectual property portfolio (e.g., patents, trademarks, and trade secrets), and leveraging this portfolio in a competitive fashion. An emphasis of this course is to help students understand that intellectual property strategy is business strategy, and that IP is a strategic business asset that can be leveraged to create value and intellectual asset formation in the marketplace."

EMBA,445,Expanding Boundaries,2,"This course will help you understand the keys to successful corporate development-competitive advantage in every business in which a firm is involved.  In particular, the course will help the participants to understand the following:
-Corporate development strategy through capabilities and leveragable capabilities
-Before venturing into a new business, the firm has to have a clear understanding of the critical capabilities required for success in the new business.
-Firms can increase the odds of success if they can leverage  (parts of ) existing capabilities to new businesses.
-Corporate development strategies-adapting to a market
-Analyze the industry environment in order to select the competitive battlefield to increase the odds of success by leveraging some of your existing capabilities - sometimes also known as core competencies.  This is a relatively low risk strategy.  We will develop methodologies that will allow you to identify markets (segments) where your current capabilities are leveragable.
-Shaping a market usually requires developing a completely new set of capabilities - very risky.  We will develop concepts to understand techniques to mitigate these risks.
-Acquisitions as one of the means for corporate development
-Approximately half of the class sessions will be devoted to the specific case of acquisitions as a means to expand the boundaries of a firm.  We will explore both how acquisitions contribute to competitive advantage and the selection process and integration of the acquired entity.  Less emphasis will be placed on strict financial valuations and negotiations.

EMBA,446,Managing Risk and Real Options,2,"The course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  In the Finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  You studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, NPV, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  Now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  The first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  The course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  We look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  Almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  The second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. In competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  As soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  Unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, DCF, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  A better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed.

EMBA,450,Managerial Marketing,2,"This course is designed with three overarching objectives. The first is an emphasis on decision making in a broad range of market contexts. The second objective builds on the notion that decision making is dynamic; that is, market situations demand not just one good decision but a series of them as a situation unfolds (providing new and varied information for each subsequent decision). Integrating concepts from a number of the courses that you are taking concurrently into decision-making about markets is a final objective.
Prereq: E.M.B.A. candidates only."
EMBA,451,Business Model Design,2,"In most companies the process of designing business models is an ad hoc process and in my opinion an inefficient process.  In this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  We will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  The first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  The second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  This seems easy because everything is in English and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  However, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.

You will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.  After the completion of this course you should be quickly able to draw the outline of a business model for any business opportunity that you're considering.

EMBA,458,Healthcare Financial Management,2,"This course will consider basic financial concepts, techniques, and strategies for institutions and companies in the U.S. health care delivery system.  Note that this may differ from the influences one would find in a different country since the payment system and ownership structures vary widely around the world.  These basics include relevant factors in the economic, medical, and financial environment that shape an intelligent financial decision.  Therefore, although the course is directed towards financial management decisions in health delivery organizations, it may also be useful for those who supply the industry (equipment, drugs and services), purchase services from it (employers, third party administrators, health plans) or finance these (insurance, banking, investors).  Public policy and the structure of the industry also play an important role in the course.  However, the general approach is from the point of view of a decision-maker in a health care organizational setting dealing with issues with important economic or financial dimensions.

Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class. The course has three examinations and a final project that includes writing an essay and staging a monologue or scene from one of the tragedies.

USNA,204,The Evolution of Scientific Ideas,3,"Scientific understanding has evolved over the years. There are very few beliefs about the natural world that have remained intact over the past few centuries, or even the past few decades. The chief goal of the course will be to give students an understanding of how scientific ideas change and how newer ideas supersede the old. Questions to be investigated include: What is Science? How do disciplinary scientific communities (physicists, chemists, biologists, etc.) form and identify themselves? How does the community of scientists within a discipline come to a consensus that it is time to adopt a new paradigm: What scientific, social, political, and cultural factors come into play during the periods of transition? The course will be in seminar format. The students will be given opportunities to explicitly develop critical thinking skills (the specific skills to be developed will be selected by the class from an explicit list) and writing and speaking skills. Class meetings will be used to share their research results and to study the assigned texts and papers. The students will be required to demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways.

Upon completion of the course, the students should be well equipped to recognize scientifically unrealistic assumptions and statements in pseudoscientific books, movies, TV programs and other mass media sources.  The course will be sufficiently flexible to allow coverage of topics that are proposed by, and interesting to, students, or the topics which would arise during discussions.

Why does it matter what we eat, and equally important, what we eat eats? Students will explore their own eating habits by keeping a journal of what, when, where, and how they eat. Discussions will focus on the social, cultural, nutritional, and technological aspects of food.

USNA,226,Evolution of Human Behavior,3,"Human behavior is a result of the complex interplay between our genes and the environment, both of which have been shaped by evolutionary forces over millions of years.  To what extent does natural selection shape our behavior today?  Are humans naturally monogamous?  Why do conflicts arise even in our most intimate relationships?  Is human behavior ultimately in the service of reproductive success, ensuring that our genes are passed into the next generation?  This course reviews the history of evolutionary theories of mind and behavior, as well as current ideas about the ecological and genetic components of behavior.  We will examine key principles of neurobiology, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology to critically evaluate evolutionary interpretations of human behaviors, including those comprising cultural traditions and social institutions.  Specific topics to be addressed include human mate choice, parenting strategies, interpersonal conflict, and altruism.  The course is structured as a seminar, with emphasis on discussion and formation of logical arguments.
Requirements to enroll: 1) Passing letter grade in a First Seminar OR concurrent enrollment in"
USNA,228,Time,3,"This seminar course will explore the nature of time from many stances, including those of Psychology, Biology, Technology and Philosophy. Yet time is central to Physics, and in Physics we will orient our explorations of time. Our understanding of time has sharpened a great deal in the last few centuries, the most obvious markers being Newton's Absolute time, which remains entrenched in modern culture, and its subsequent physical overthrow by Einstein's relativity. Given the physical primacy of Einstein's time, many questions arise: How malleable is the concept of time? Is there a fact of time? Can the present be defined? The past? The future? The successes of modern Cosmology lead us to ask: Was there a beginning of time? Will time end? The symmetry of fundamental physical laws with respect to the direction of time, counterpointed by asymmetric phenomena, lead to: Is there a master arrow of time? Is the flow of time an illusion? In this course we will investigate what ""Time"" is telling us about the natural world and ourselves.
Requirements to enroll: 1) Passing letter grade in a First Seminar OR concurrent enrollment in"
USNA,237,Landscape History and Conservation,3,"Human history is intimately intertwined with the natural landscape on which it occurred.  From coastal preserves and their beach communities to Midwestern farmland and the preserved site of Thoreau's Walden Pond cabin, and at places like the Grand Canyon, the American landscape itself holds many clues to our country's natural, ecological, and cultural history.  This course will investigate the lived landscape in two ways (which have a multitude of shades to them):  as a place where humans shape the natural for their own memorial, productive, and aesthetic uses, or as a natural place that humans set aside or conserve.  We will read landscape history and conservation theory, and we will consider global practices of conservation through UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.  Class work will entail a process-oriented project on the Cleveland landscape, which students are encouraged to approach through the lens of their major.  We will visit the Wade Oval and the cultural gardens of Rockefeller Park as an example of current conservation practices working to protect the natural and cultural value of the local landscape.
Requirements to enroll: 1) Passing letter grade in a First Seminar OR concurrent enrollment in"

We will also trace the development of city infrastructure such as electricity, water and sewage systems, streets bridges, and subways.  Technological innovations, such as the automobile, will receive special consideration.  We will move moth geographically and temporally to visit the world's great cities, studying examples of significant building projects, such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chicago World's Fair, and Cleveland's first skyscraper, the Rockefeller Building.  The course will cover the history of the professions--engineering, architecture, and urban planning--that have contributed to the construction of cities, and will review the works of these practitioners, as well as that of artists, reformers, and utopians that have imagined new directions for the city.

USNA,247,Epidemics in Human History,3,"This course will examine the role of epidemics (of all types) in human history.  Disease has shaped our society in many ways and continues to do so.  Despite the plethora of antibiotic and antiviral drugs since 1940, 90% of the decrease in (First World) infectious disease is due to simple public health measures and better hygiene.  But overuse of antibiotics increasingly is causing the rapid evolution of ""superbugs"" that threaten new plagues and epidemics.  Both historical and modern epidemics of plague, smallpox, Salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS will be examined.  The interaction of these epidemics with societies and how the epidemics influence society, cultures, art, and literature will be major topics of discussion.  The course is primarily discussion with short student presentations.  In addition, 3-4 short ""Front Lines"" talks by and discussion with CWRU and University Hospital clinicians will explore today's realities of epidemics, infection, and antibiotic resistance in the United States, Uganda, South Africa and elsewhere.

USNA,249,Restoring the Great Lakes: Opportunities and Challenges,3,"This seminar will focus on the issues and methods of restoring the Great Lakes, with particular emphasis on public action and decision-making processes.  Students will learn about the environmental history of the lakes, as well as current challenges to improving water quality and related aspects of the ecosystem.  Technical experts, field trips, and other informational resources will enable seminar participants to engage in lively debates on the best ways to address those challenges.  Opportunities for observation of and/or direct collaboration with key stakeholders in the restoration process will enhance students' understanding of the processes by which key environmental decisions are made and implemented.

USNA,252,The Future of Food,3,"Since World War II, science and technology have transformed the way Americans produce and consume food.  This transformation has been supported by government policies and accomplished through the application of industrial methods in agriculture, food processing, and food delivery.  Such methods have allowed a tiny fraction of the American population to produce vast quantities of food products at very low prices for American consumers.  

But this American diet, while inexpensive, has turned out to be high in sugar, fat, and processed grains that are contributing to chronic disease such as diabetes and obesity.  In addition, environmental impacts of confined animal feeding operations, vast monoculture grain production, and global food transport are raising questions about the sustainability of American agribusiness.  

This seminar will explore the evolution of food production in the United States since World War II and will ask the question: is it possible to nourish the world's population using nutrition and flavor as guiding principles rather than cost?  What is the true meaning of ""sustainability"" in agriculture?  The last third of the course will be devoted to creating a plan for using part of the University Farm to grow food for the University.

USNA,258,Designing Urban Green Space,3,"In this course, we will investigate the history, theory and practical design of green space in cities.  We will focus on types of green space and their community function, relationship to commerce, aesthetics, recreation, ecology, and health in particular.  Students will engage in group projects where they locate all underused space in Cleveland (vacant space, gray or brown fields) and will propose a new use for it as green space of some kind.  Individual research projects will be related to that site.  Lively class discussion and frequent reading responses required.  Mandatory field trip to sites in downtown Cleveland.

USNA,259,Bring Out Your Dead,3,"This course examines the interplay between history and plague outbreaks.  Course readings draw largely on the writings and experiences of scientists, physicians, and public health officials.  By taking a historical approach to the study of the relationship between human history and the history of disease, students will learn about the development of the scientific method (namely the slow process by which humans learned to identify, categorize, and respond to disease), how science develops in specific historic contexts, the consequence of scientific inquiry, and what humans do when they are faced with imminent death.  A tentative list of plagues includes: the Athenian Plague, Black Death, Yellow Fever, TB, Malaria, Influenza in 1918, and AIDS.

USNA,260,Life in the Past,3,"This course will focus on how we learn, discover, and make conclusions about life in the deep past.  What types of life were present?  And how can we understand their extinction?  A principal focus will be how extinctions in North and South America have affected both the land and its animals and, consequently, the course of human development.  We will look at megafauna from the local area in conjunction with the ""Extreme Mammals"" exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, read about the fossil boom, study the Dodo, and look at scientific ways in which animals are currently being completely re-imagined via technology (computer bone/muscle articulation, eating habits, climate models, etc.).  We will also look at the cultural ways in which we view these ""dinosaurs"" (movies, children's books, museum exhibits) and see if it helps or hurts our scientific and historical understanding of them.  At heart, our main question will be: can you really understand a time, space and creature that has been extinct for millions of years?  How?  Why?  And why do these ""monsters"" hold such fascination for us?  Does their disappearance bode well of the human race?

USNA,265,Thinking National Parks,3,"This seminar provides students an opportunity to explore U.S. national parks and their history of displaying both nature and culture.  This discussion-based, writing- and research-focused class requires students to examine a park system that is both extraordinarily popular and rife with controversy.  We begin with several recurring questions: Where did the national parks idea come from?  How has the park mission evolved and adapted?  Can parks be ""read"" as texts, and if so, how does our point of view determine what we see?  How do parks arrange displays of cultural and natural worlds, and how do they display interactions therein?  How can changing park philosophies be reflected in their physical apparatus and infrastructure?

Students will participate in regular class discussions, occasionally lead these same discussions, complete formal writing assignments, and develop a final research project.  The course readings will alternate between historical and present-day selections, so that we explore the history of U.S. national parks while simultaneously considering challenges and controversies that matter very much today.  Early readings will include John Muir and Gifford Pinchot; current trends will be explored in the writings of William Cronon, Alfred Runte, and Jennifer Price, among many others.  We will view significant portions of Ken Burns' recent PBS series The National Parks: America's Best Idea.

The ultimate ""text"" for the class, however, is an actual national park.  Each student will choose a national park as the basis for their semester-long project.  Students will begin with description and history of their park, and then they will explore controversies or other issues in the park, developing their own argument.  Next, students will have a chance to play architect/landscaper/park-superintendent, as they propose a change to the park that would address an existing problem or enhance the visitors' experience.  Finally, students will gather these pieces into a single coherent project, submitting a 10-15 page final essay as well as producing an engaging class presentation.

USNA,266,Life After the Death of Print,3,"Around 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the moveable type printing press, a technological development that altered the world by ushering in an era of mass, reproducible communication.  For nearly 500 years, print technologies have dominated communications.  Scholars have shown that print's ability to disseminate information led to revolutions in art, science and politics.  In short, print technologies have largely defined what it means to be a thinking and communicating human being.  The emergence of digital technologies has altered communications in ways that are only now being understood.  This course examines how developments in digital technologies impact communication practices by threatening print's historic stronghold.  Consequently, the course also explores what impact new technologies have on human identity.  We will consider the historical development of display technologies (printed materials and digital screens) to understand what is at stake in the move from print to digital communication.  We will then investigate current phenomena associated with Web 2.0, including blogs and social networks, in order to understand how our communication choices construct and allow for our public and private identities.  Additionally, the course will examine new display technologies, such as iPhones and Kindles, that allow for the possibly constant dissemination of those identities.  Finally, we will hypothesize about how digital technologies force us to conceive of human identity differently from the ways that print invites.

USNA,271,"Gene, Environment and Behavior",3,"The goal of this course is to encourage students to be well informed and critical consumers of the media reports about the influence of genes and environment on human behavior. This course involves the book by Matt Ridley titled, ""Genome: The autobiography of a species in 23 chapters."" Ridley has a Ph.D. in zoology, worked as a journalist, science editor, and national newspaper columnist. The book devotes a chapter to each pair of human chromosomes. Each chapter focuses on the role of a gene. Ridley's book was published in 1999; therefore, students will conduct their own research to update each of the chapters in Ridley's book. The first few weeks of class will be used to provide a background on genetics research through field trips and guest lectures from CWRU genetic researchers. We will have several writing workshops spread throughout the semester to offer ""Just in Time"" tips needed to write critical evaluations and literature reviews. Each student will present twice during the semester. The first oral presentation will revolve around a summary, critical evaluation, and an update of the human trait presented in the Ridley book on their assigned chromosome. The presentation will be about 15 minutes with 5 minutes left for questions. Students not presenting will be assigned one of the three chromosomes (chapters) covered that day and they will each write a seminar question to pose to the class. In addition, each student will also serve as a reviewer for one of the presentations to provide constructive feedback to the presenter. The second presentation will consist of new material found by each student about genes on their chromosome. They must find another trait on their chromosome and present the most current information available on that trait. In place of a final exam, each student will turn in a research paper on their assigned chromosome. We will build these papers throughout the semester with a series of graded ""checkpoint"" assignments.

USNA,272,The Thames Watershed,3,"In this seminar, we will investigate the London, England-area Thames watershed and its associated concerns, like urban development, watershed management, aquatic species conservation, and habitat engineering and restoration. A critical part of this seminar will be a spring break field trip to London. On the field trip, we will focus on London's rivers and their history and ecology. We will study the Lea River Valley (where the 2012 summer Olympic Village is located), the Fleet River and various water-related constructions, such as Docklands, Regent's Canal, and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Nature Reserve, each from historical and ecological standpoints. Emphasis will be on how humans have treated the watershed historically, from using the rivers as sewers and transportation links, to restoring their ecosystems, as is the current case in the Lea River Valley. Course readings will be a mix of cultural history, London newspapers archives, and scientific studies on riparian corridor management. Students will keep field journals in London and will write an experiential learning essay about how the field trip intersected with the readings we've discussed in the seminar. They will also write a 10-12 page research paper on one of the ecological issues witnessed in London and its significance.

This class will critically examine each perspective by looking at the history of the relationship between science and religion and the philosophical issues that have arisen therein. We will then use what we have learned to see if we can make progress on contemporary debates surrounding science education.

USNA,283,Cultures of Science,3,"From the laboratory to the museum, science is a dominant way in which we make sense of the world.  This seminar examines the cultures of science.  Drawing on the fields of anthropology, sociology, history, and science and technology studies, we explore the interplay, exchange, and fertile ground between ""culture"" and ""science.""  We analyze the cultural practices of scientists, the relationship between scientific and indigenous ways of knowing, and ethics of scientific knowledge, as well as scientifically mediated understandings of personhood, nation, legality, and truth.  We will consider case studies from the U.S., Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia that reflect on contemporary intellectual debates and public concerns.  The course considers the following questions: Is science cultural?  What does objectivity mean?  How are scientific facts produced?  Do our understandings of citizenship and the nation have any connection to science?

USNA,285,The Science of Madness: An Historical Investigation of Mental Illness,3,"Since antiquity the western world's understanding of mental illness has continued to evolve.  This course will examine the trajectory of that evolution, looking at the medical theories that have influenced assumptions about the causes and treatments of mental illness from the early modern era through the twenty-first century.  Examples of questions we will investigate include: How we have defined the normal and the pathological in human mental behavior over time?  How do we explain the centuries-old correlation that medicine has made between creativity and mental illness?  Which past and present psychiatric treatments have been beneficial and which harmful?  How did Darwin's theory of evolution affect theories of mental illness (and how does it continue to do so with the advent of evolutionary psychology)?  How have changing philosophies of science affected the research and practice of psychology?  How and why do the sciences of the mind--psychiatry, psychoanalysis, clinical psychology, psychopharmacology, the cognitive neurosciences--claim so much scientific authority and exert influence over our lives today?  As a frame work for this inquiry, the class will use the concept of paradigm shifts as Thomas Kuhn defines in his classic work, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

USNA,286,Science and the Paranormal,3,"From paranormal television programs to the academic study of parapsychology, claims about the ""science"" of the paranormal abound.  This seminar examines the ways in which people have attempted to scientifically explore questions of life after death, the soul, and anomalous phenomena such as ghosts, telepathy, and ESP.  The seminar begins by exploring the emergence of psychical research and parapsychology in the late nineteenth century.  We then critically analyze a variety of purportedly scientific approaches to the paranormal and analyze their understandings of nature and science.  By exploring the claims of paranormal researchers, parapsychologists, and fringe scientists, we will analyze the constitution of science and its demarcation from pseudoscience.  We consider a variety of methodological and heuristic tools to distinguish science from non-science such as falsifiability and Occam's razor and apply them to paranormal claims.  We also analyze the criticisms leveled at paranormal research.  We ask the following questions.  What is science?  What distinguishes it from ""pseudoscience"" or non-science?  What is skepticism?  Can there be a science of the paranormal?  What understanding of the natural world is the paranormal grounded on?  What is the relationship among science, religion, and belief?

USNA,287A,Perspectives on the Cosmos: From the Ancient Philosophers to Modern Science,3,"For all of recorded history, and presumably well before that, people have asked the Big Questions: What is the nature of the Universe? How big is it? How old? What is our place in it? For just as long, we've been making up the answers.

Cosmology is the subject that seeks to answer the big questions. As such, it is the nexus where science, philosophy, and religion collide. This course will explore the subject of cosmology, from both an historical and scientific perspective. In the process, we will examine the roles of faith, philosophy, and empirical knowledge. We will survey prevailing attitudes towards the nature of the world model over time, examining the impact of belief systems on the interpretation of physical evidence. Subjects to be covered include the first vital steps of the ancient philosophers, the tension between geocentric and heliocentric world models at the time of Copernicus and Galileo, and the modern scientific world view.

Students will learn to critically examine evidence and its interpretation, and to appreciate the strengths and shortcomings of various forms of human knowledge. Emphasis will be placed on the importance and limitations of empirical evidence, and the dangers inherent in the interpretation of evidence within a preconceived framework. The student will gain an appreciation for the historical development of world models, culminating with modern cosmology. In the process comes a respect for the diverse paths to knowledge followed by humanity.

USNA,287B,Electrical and Electronic Devices in Our Lives,3,"Electrical circuits and embedded microprocessors control a great many aspects of our daily life including the power grid, medical devices, consumer electronics and infrastructure. This seminar will introduce students to electricity, electrical circuits, measurement, the Arduino microprocessor development platform, the engineering design process and how the above devices work. Laboratory time will allow students to create circuits and programs to interact with and control some aspect of the environment. As part of the course, students will examine how simple errors encountered during laboratory work compare to the errors and oversights which have caused disasters. A project will ask students to design a simple device to address a problem or need and will provide the foundation for writing assignments at the end of the course. Students will make use of the Sears Design Laboratory and the Think[Box] facility.

We eat some animals and consider other animals members of our family.  We worship some animals and vilify others.  This class examines the complexities of our relationship with (non-human) animals.  Through exploring human emotional, practical, and epistemological ties with animals, this course examines what it means to be animal as well as what it means to be human.  We analyze the following questions.  How do we come to know and understand animals?  What are the issues surrounding the use of animals in scientific speculation, classification and experimentation, such as vivisection, cloning and the human-animal relationship in technoscience?  Do some non-human animals possess material culture, social morality, and emotions such as grief and sadness?  Why do animals populate our popular culture and art?

USNA,287D,Native American Environmentalism: Sustainability and Contemporary Energy,3,"This seminar course will focus on three main areas of Native American environmentalism.  First, we will learn about Native Cosmologies and historical connections to the land while exposing the controversial relationship of Native Americans to land and wildlife within the myth of the ""ecological Indian."" Second, we will examine how Native Americans have responded to toxic pollution of indigenous lands as a result of manufacturing and uranium mining, which some refer to as ""environmental racism."" We will also learn about tribes who choose to host nuclear waste facilities as an exercise of their sovereignty and as an avenue of economic development.  Finally, we will investigate initiatives by tribes and coalitions in land and water stewardship, investment in ""new"" energies and technologies, sustainability of lands (prairie and forest restoration), reclamation of waterways (dam removal), and wildlife management, to name a few. Students will inform their critical thinking about Native American environmentalism with a variety of texts and websites of scholarly and public opinion, scientific data, native knowledge, and historic fact.  The seminar will include collaborative learning and presentation projects in which students will pursue research topics related to energy development, stewardship and sustainability, or wildlife management and harvesting.

USNA,287F,"Environment and the Fates of Societies: Guns, Germs, and Steel",3,"This University Seminar deals with the connections between human societies and landscape, climate, pathogens, and plant and animal species. The main method for this exploration is a close reading of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. Diamond explains that Western Europeans came to occupy and dominate large areas of the globe because of natural resources present in certain regions of the Old World since the end of the last Ice Age. For example, Diamond studies ancient patterns of plant diffusion or the place of mountain ranges and deserts in the development of technologies. Seminar participants will also study historical sources from specific times and places - namely North America from European contact to 1850 - and compare them to Diamond's general environmental explanations and models. Placing Diamond's broad explanations within specific historical contexts is revealing. A range of alternative methods, perspectives, primary sources from North America, and case studies (especially in environmental history) help develop a critical understanding of the complexities of the fates of societies.

Advances in genetics (the study of individual genes), and genomics (the study of an entire genome) have fundamentally altered our understanding of biology.  In this seminar, we will focus on topics covered by the mainstream press.  We will explore the science behind the news and discuss the philosophical, ethical and societal concerns raised by these scientific advances.  Topics will include: the dangers and benefits of genetically modified crops; genetics and the conservation of endangered species; learning about human biology and disease from yeast, flies, worms and fish; the use and potential misuse of genetic fingerprinting by government agencies; genetic testing; personalized medicine; and issues of genetic privacy.

USNA,287H,Plants in Medicine,3,"Plants have always been the basis of medicinal treatments, and as they continue to be essential to modern forms of medicine, alternative and traditional alike.  In this course, we will consider the history of how humans have used particular plants for medicinal purposes, such as the cinchona tree (Cinchona officinalis) for quinine, willow bark (Salix) for aspirin, and the yew tree (Taxus baccata) for the cancer medication paclitaxel.  By investigating how a plant is used medicinally through time, we will also come to understand the culture that used it and how they conceived of health in relationship to nature.  We will read texts that show how a plant's medicinal uses can be tied to colonialism and global exploration.  For example, the first botanical gardens were collections of medicinal plants cultivated for use and experimentation, often containing non-native plant-based cures discovered through colonial contact.  While this is not a course in botany per se, we will be discussing basic plant biology, cultivation practices, and the contemporary science of using plants as the basis for pharmaceutical cures.  Students should be active course participants in class discussion and on field trips.  Writing instruction will focus on research-based argument, and students will complete a researched essay focusing on a medicinal plant of their choice.

USNA,287J,Transportation in American Life,3,"We will explore the critical role of transportation in the development of our cities, regions, states, and nation. The course will consider the historic role of transportation, its current role, and what role it might play in the future. Transportation will be viewed in the context of national policies, overall political will, and our culture at large.

Since colonial times, transportation, in its many forms, has been the subject of intense debate, governmental policies, as well as the subject of public and private investment. We will see how certain individuals and groups used ego, power, and wealth to use transportation for shaping the nation's commerce, travel patterns, and physical appearance. We'll also see the evolution of government and business in transportation decisions and funding.

Finally, because of transportation's daily impact, we will look at current issues as part of every class. We will especially focus on the transportation issues of northeast Ohio, a microcosm of national transportation issues. Some of these issues include funding, decision-making, land use, ""suburban sprawl,"" and economic development. We'll also look at transportation issues specific to the University Circle area such as the Health Line and the proposed ""Opportunity Corridor.""

But how much do we really want to know - and who gets to decide? Is DNA our destiny? Should the quest for scientific knowledge trump cultural belief? How does society balance risk to a few in the face of the needs of the many? Using a blend of historical documents and literary examples, we will examine the evolution of the ethical standards that govern how doctors experiment on their patients. We will also debate the hard choices that medical researchers make when the quest for scientific truth intersects with cultural belief. Finally, we will apply what we have learned to find solutions to real-world ethical problems in medical research.

USNA,287P,Women and Science: Changing Paradigms,3,"Is science objectively neutral in that true scientific knowledge would be independent of the discoverer? In this view, the scientific discoverer is more like a midwife that brings forth pre-existing knowledge to the world. Or - is scientific knowledge guided and shaped by the people who practice science, in which case it is influenced by the social context in which it occurs, making the scientist more like a sculptor who creates something new using the tools that are currently available.

In this course we will examine this second question by looking specifically at the relationship of gender to science through several lenses. One approach we will use is make case studies of the lives of major women scientists and the way that their gender impacted their work, from the type of scientific research they pursued, the kind of support and encouragement that they obtained as they proceeded in their careers, to the rewards and recognition (or the lack of them) that their work received from their peers.

Using a more conjectural line of inquiry, we will also consider the role that gender might have played in developing scientific theories and whether there can be such categories as ""masculinist"" and ""feminist"" science. We will conclude this part of our inquiry with an analysis of the current state of science and how well these approaches reflect the way science is pursued today.

A third issue involves looking at the relationship of gender and science but from the opposite direction. In other words, we will consider how science has influenced our understanding of gender, rather than how gender has influenced science. Over time, scientific ideas about the physiological and intellectual differences between males and females have changed dramatically several times with major political and sociological ramifications. Consequently, we will examine the science of gender in its cultural and political context from antiquity through the twentieth century. 

In order to explore these interweaving threads, we will be taking an interdisciplinary approach that will draw on the history and philosophy of science (particularly Thomas Kuhn's The Revolution of Scientific Ideas), as well as on anthropology and cultural theory. By the conclusion of the course we will have examined the scientific evidence that has supported assumptions about gender in various philosophical paradigms, including humanism, rationalism (i.e., Enlightenment philosophy), nineteenth century moralism, modernism, and postmodernism.

From the ocean voyage to the space mission, from the discovery of electricity to gene-splicing, men and women have sought to explore the boundaries of knowledge. However, such explorations often come at a cost. New scientific discovery in the 18th century--from neurology to reproduction to electricity--caused as much fear as excitement. The Enlightenment focus on clarity and rationality harbors a dark double self that appears as monstrosity in early Gothic fiction.

USNA,287T,Conflicts and Controversies in American Science and Technology,3,"How do changes in science and technology affect American life? How do cultural ideas shape scientific practice? Is technological progress inevitable, or do we get to decide what changes we want and which ones we don't? How do we make ethical choices about science and technology in a world with inherent power imbalances?

This course provides an introduction to thinking through these questions by presenting works by historians, anthropologists, political scientists, philosophers, journalists, and others to explore a range of social issues in modern science and technology. After two weeks of introduction, the course is divided into four sections: (a) Biology, Biotech, and Biomedicine; (b) Science Policy and the Politics of Science; (c) Problems in Social Science; and (d) Computers and Other Thinking Machines. While the course's content is arranged around these topics, its main purposes are to develop critical thinking skills around ubiquitous and contentious subjects of science, technology, power, culture, and values as well as to hone skills in reading, speaking, research, and essay writing.

USNA,287Y,Large Scale Energy Storage,3,"In our wired society, energy storage for the distribution of electric energy is a major ""game changer.""  Efficient and economic large-scale energy storage will help facilitate the growth of renewable energy in the market, as well as increase the overall efficiency of our current electric energy resources.  So what needs to happen before we can begin to enjoy these benefits?  This course will examine the broad challenges of large-scale energy storage.   In what ways do our current technologies prevent us from storing large amounts of energy efficiently and conveniently?  How has the marketplace helped or hindered technological improvement?  How might government policy encourage advancements in energy storage technologies?  Major topics of the course include the global and US energy outlook; the relationship between energy storage, delivery, and use; the role of energy storage for renewable energy implementation; characteristics and challenges of different energy storage technologies; the potential political, public policy, economic, and environmental impact of large-scale energy storage; and approaches to energy storage in other parts of the world.

USNA,287Z,"Simple Harmonies, Complex Meanings: Music, A Human Obsession",3,"Throughout history and across cultures, the act of creating and enjoying music remains a prominent and defining element of the human species.  What is its purpose and role within our lives?  To what extent do we actively and passively engage with music on a daily basis?  Do perceptions of music differ from individual to individual and culture to culture, or can we consider music to be a universal language?  This course will utilize neurological findings and representative case studies to examine the cognitive processes associated with the perception of music and to investigate the basis of our obsession with music. Topics may include the development of musical preference, how societal influences affect our perception of music, and the role of expertise in the consumption of music.

USNA,288C,Physics for Future Innovators & World Leaders,3,"We live in an increasingly technological society.  Advances in technology improve our lives in countess ways, but they sometimes produce problems and challenges that are so complex that the average business or political leader may not understand them--and therefore cannot make effective decisions to address them.  Whether the problem is what to do about climate change, deciding on which sources of energy are worthy of investment, updating the electrical grid, or how to deal with terrorist threats, we will be able to find the best solutions only if our leaders have an adequate understanding of the underlying physical principles (e.g., energy, force, space, radiation, electricity, and exponential growth), and where to find credible information that will assist in answering key questions.  This course is designed to equip students with that knowledge.  We will also explore various ""conversation"" that pertain to the above issues with the goal of gaining a better understanding of differing points of view (e.g., reporter, scientist, business person, politician, parent, student, people from different cultures), and how rudimentary understanding of the science behind some of our most pressing technological problems can affect a person's stance or actions.  This seminar is appropriate for undergraduates of any major.

USNA,288G,"Sense and Sensibility: Sensing, Information, and Control",3,"The control of systems has been crucial to technology development since antiquity and has been the key to ushering in some of the biggest transformations of the world including the industrial revolution, the age of aviation, and the modern computer era.  Control systems permeate our world and many of the technologies we take for granted and modern life as we know it would not be possible without them.
This seminar examines the questions of ""What is the role of feedback control in both creating technology and understanding the natural world?"" and ""How have these roles evolved and interacted with one another?""  To this end, beginning with control in antiquity and early industrial control systems and continuing into the present, the design and implementation of feedback to regulate system behavior and control programs to direct processes will be explored.
Early industrial control systems corresponding to feedback control systems and control programs, respectively, and their continued evolution will be traced and the impact of their integration in the modern era will be used to expose the roles of observation, information, and computation in achieving control objectives.  Finally, this seminar will address the future of control systems including the incorporation of new design paradigms such as biomimetic and biologically-inspired control systems, their application to large scale systems and networks, and the new understanding of biological systems engendered by these new developments and applications.

USNA,288I,Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies,3,"The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. 

Cleveland is one such place exploring innovative approaches to support new businesses. For over ten years, there has been a massive intervention of government and donor resources to cultivate this entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Has this intervention worked in Cleveland?  How should success be measured?  How does Cleveland's approach differ from approaches elsewhere around the world?  

In an unusual twist for a SAGES seminar, the regular classroom discussions will be complemented by your enrollment in a massive open online course (MOOC) that I developed for CWRU. The MOOC is called ""Beyond Silicon Valley:  Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies"" and examines the Cleveland case study in depth.  The course has attracted over 44,000 students from 190 countries since its launch in April 2014. So, not only will you explore how communities around the world support entrepreneurship, you will also learn about the rapidly developing field of online learning and MOOCs.

But why does cellulose burn at 451 degrees and not some other temperature? Why do other materials ignite at other temperatures? What exactly happens when materials burn? How can we apply an understanding of the chemistry of combustion to various engineering and social challenges? For example, how does one test flammability? How can we use this knowledge to reduce fire accidents, for example by producing less flammable materials? To inform our investigation, we will read about the history of fire and society, experiment with the basics of materials combustion and testing, and observe how this knowledge is applied at a flammability testing facility.

USNA,288L,Future Energy: @home&abroad,3,"Among the greatest societal challenges we face today is to find means of meeting our energy requirements without jeopardizing the environment or fostering geopolitical conflicts. This course investigates what we can do both individually and collectively to tackle this challenge. The questions we will consider include: To what extent is the world aware of the energy challenge and its environmental implications? What is already being done to meet this challenge? What role can technology play in addressing it? What research can we be doing now to help predict the future of our energy needs and potential environmental impacts? By investigating these questions, students will develop a fuller and more precise understanding of the energy challenge, as well as generate possible solutions. As an important and indeed unique aspect of this course that will greatly enhance their learning experience, students will compare strategies implemented in the State of Ohio and an international location to meet the energy and the environment challenge. To this end the course will require enrolled students to join the instructor in an international location for five or more days over a University break to visit energy conversion and storage installations involving solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind farms, geothermal and hydroelectric and acquire profound knowledge of technological and economic factors involved in their operation and maintenance. Students may not receive credit for both"
USNA,288M,Spirits and Synapses,3,"This seminar is designed to explore the exciting new advances in understanding sleep and how nighttime sleep impacts daily activities.  The seminar will begin with a brief and general overview of the human brain during sleep and how brain activity varies during sleep.  We will then consider various questions related to sleep. Why do we do sleep? What makes sleep so mysterious and interesting to think about? What are dreams? Why do we sleepwalk? How does a basic understanding of neurophysiology help us understand sleep and its importance for health? How does technology influence our sleep? Our discussions will also extend to the ethical and social implications associated with sleep disorders including self-imposed sleep loss and corresponding personal and legal liabilities. 

Readings and assignments will include overviews of comparative sleep durations between species including humans, and current sleep testing technologies and their application to modern medicine.  In addition to reading, discussing, and writing about sleep, this course will use role-playing as an experiential means of understanding the ethical dilemmas associated with sleep loss.

USNA,288R,Data Acquisition and the Internet of Things,3,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or ""things"" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. Example objects include garage door minders that send texts when we have forgotten to close them or cars that report driving habits to insurance companies. This class proposes to explore the question ""What is involved in creating an 'Internet of Things' device and what might the future of the IoT look like?""  Virtually everyone benefits from the Internet of Things, but for most individuals the IoT is little understood.  The goal here is to demystify the IoT by engaging students in a guided hands-on IoT project that begins with data acquisition and concludes in a working device.  Through the project, readings, and discussion, students will be challenged to consider a future world that is even more connected than today and to consider the practical, societal and ethical issues that the IoT creates.

Over the last century, science has allowed us to figure out how to take something as common as beach sand and to use it to create the sophisticated products on which our modern society depends.  In this seminar we will explore the use of silicon in everything from transistors to complex microprocessors to smartphones to solar cells and sensors.   We will seek to understand the following sorts of questions: What properties make this element so useful?  What are the processes by which we take this material and turn it into the technologically sophisticated devices?  How did people figure out that silicon could be used to make these advanced devices? Did they anticipate all these uses? Are there other materials that might in the future replace silicon for these purposes?  What are the benefits and drawbacks of silicon relative to other materials? To help students more fully understand how silicon devices work, they will work in groups to design a simple device.

USNA,288W,Medieval Sciences and Human Difference: How Did Medieval Peoples Define Humanity?,3,"Since the beginning of recorded history, humans have employed different approaches to defining themselves in relation to the natural world. Along with folklore, religion and philosophy, science has been an important means to define concepts we now refer to as race/ethnicity, dis/ability, sexuality, and gender. However, what constituted science and scientific inquiry varied widely based on culture and historical context. Most recently, our advancing understanding of genetics has produced ever more nuanced definitions of human difference, even as we have come to recognize that such explanations often compete with theories that are grounded in social and cultural values, rather than scientific observation. How did people explain human diversity in the 1000 years before the Scientific Revolution unfolded in Europe? 
In this seminar, we will investigate how different medieval cultures explained humanity and human diversity by sampling examples of medical observation, philosophy, theories about the natural world, cultural prejudice, and religious belief. In particular, we will consider how Greek, Roman, Chinese, Indian, Islamicate, and early European theories of human difference shaped justifications for conquest as, gender roles and sexuality, often in surprising ways. Questions we will ask include: How did medieval people differentiate humans from animals? Did they use the same categories of race, gender, and sexuality that we use? How did scientific thinking evolve to construct these taxonomies of difference? How were ideas shared cross-culturally? To explore these questions, we will read primary texts in translation from the medieval period. Through our discussions, we will consider not only what other approaches to defining human differences can teach us, but how they provide historical insight into frameworks and assumptions about diversity today.

They are used to cure sexually transmitted diseases, to ward off complications after surgery, and to boost the yield and safety of our food supply. This widespread use has created a significant problem: antibiotic-resistant ""superbugs"" are emerging at an alarming rate. It has been estimated that the useful lifetime of an antibiotic is only eight years. What can physicians, patients, policy-makers, corporations, and consumers do to address this trend? In this seminar, we will examine the science and history of antibiotics, some of the reasons for their overuse, and possible solutions to the problem of antibiotic resistance.

USNA,289B,Everyday Toxic Chemicals,3,"Each of us uses hundreds of chemicals every day.  While many of these chemicals are designed to make our products safer, cheaper, more convenient to use, and more effective, they can also present risks to ourselves and to the environment. Certainly, there are times when the benefits of using toxic chemicals outweigh the risk. For example, if you were on a ship that had caught fire, you would probably want to use the best possible firefighting foam, even if it were toxic. On the other hand, if you were choosing which microwave popcorn to buy, you might choose the one that did not use a cancer-causing chemical on the bags, even though it made them less grease-proof. How do we determine whether a chemical is toxic? Who decides when the risks outweigh the benefits? In this seminar, we will analyze the lifecycle of everyday products such as food packaging and shampoo, tracing their path from production, to use, to final place in the environment. We will also examine methods to evaluate the risk chemicals present to ourselves and to wildlife, and how these evaluation paradigms inform regulations.

USNA,289C,Gender and Technology,3,"Technology has become an essential part of our daily life--the way we experience the world and think about it--and, as such, is also central to how we understand our identities and status. This seminar will explore the ways in which gender and technology define and redefine each other, considering both how gender shapes technology and the technological professions, and how technology itself produces ideas and practices of gender and sexuality. While the course will focus on gender and sexuality, we will also examine how they intersect with other categories such as class, race, and ethnicity. How does technology offer possibilities for new social relations? What role have women played in the development of technology? How does technology both challenge and maintain gender, race, and class hierarchies? How does technology shape our understanding of sexuality and gender roles? Why are there so few women in STEM? What is the impact of feminism on technological innovations and can we create a feminist technology? The course will examine these questions through a focus on three thematic units: Gender of Technology, Gender in Technology, and the Technology of Gender, looking at historical and contemporary developments from the nineteenth century to the present.

USNA,289D,The Practice of Environmental Justice,3,"More than 50 years ago, Rachel Carson published her groundbreaking work Silent Spring, which helped to sound the alarm about the dangers of using certain kinds of petrochemical pesticides on our farms, gardens, and public lands. She showed that the physical environment, far from being a pristine wilderness isolated from human activity, is actually a sphere we need to monitor with care. If we fail to do so, we risk poisoning ourselves.  In this class, we use Carson as an introduction to the field of environmental justice, defined as the convergence of social justice and environmental movements. Environmental justice exists today in three broad areas: social and political activism in local and international communities; legal and policy structures and initiatives; and academic contributions across many disciplines. Students will read articles from these perspectives, and we will encounter difficult ethical problems, including the fact that poor and minority communities are disproportionately exposed to toxic sites. Students will collaborate with peers in researching an environmental justice site or problem, and everyone will produce an independently written and researched argument that makes a specific proposal for change. We will use the environment of Cleveland and northeast Ohio as our starting point for studying pollution, recovery, and the many ways that environmental justice might help communities to thrive.

USNA,289E,Medieval Robots,3,"The medieval world had robots. Some were housed in medieval churches where altarpieces with angels could move, ascending and descending during celebrations. Others appeared in travel narratives like those of Marco Polo. During his visit to the Mongols, the merchant and explorer described gold peacocks whose wings flapped and mechanical drinking fountains. Still others are detailed in literature. Authors of romances have Arthur's knights fighting automaton warriors to gain entry into castles and receiving gifts like teleporting brass horses. While machines in the medieval period were not as ubiquitous as they are in our modern lives, they posed many of the same questions and concerns that we have about our own technology. Writers frequently incorporated robots into travel narratives and poetry to identify exotic or foreign cultures, and such details can tell us much about racial and political identity in the period. Further, automatons and machines could be used as examples of dangerous luxury or viewed as marvels of engineering that challenged the boundaries between what was created by human hands and by God. This class will use a variety of texts and artifacts--medieval literature, blueprints, and art alongside current writings about the ethics of AI--to think about the role of machines in the medieval world and in our own modern lives. In addition to talking and writing about examples of medieval machines and technology, students will also build their own machines using think[box].

In this seminar, students will investigate unanswered questions about the biology of sleep and dreams, including how sleep impacts and is impacted by wakefulness. We will read about and discuss the meaning of consciousness and the changes that occur in the body during wakefulness, sleep, and dreaming. And we will examine these states primarily from the biological perspective, with attention to the psychological and social influences and effects as well. In applying these perspectives, students will develop familiarity with approaches used to study sleep physiology, including the use of objective measures of altered states of consciousness, as well as narrative descriptions of individuals' experiences when normal sleep patterns are disrupted. In addition, students will investigate their own sleep and dreams.

USNA,289N,The Mind's Essential Tension,3,"The idea that the mind is fundamentally divided has been around from ancient to modern times. Sometimes this division is explicitly claimed to be a critical feature of human nature; other times it is expressed as different ways of being-in or experiencing the world; in yet other cases the focus is on contrasting domains that the mind either apprehends or creates. Examples include: yin vs. yang, spiritual vs material, numinous vs. mundane, masculine vs. feminine, mind vs. body/matter, theoretical vs. practical reason, science vs. arts/humanities, reason vs. passion, normative vs descriptive, fact vs. value, poetry vs. prose, to have vs. to be, doing vs. being, left brain vs. right brain, empathizing vs. systemizing, thinking fast vs. slow.
There can be no doubt that the notion of a divided mind has proven intuitively appealing to many. However, to what degree is such an idea supported by careful and rigorous scholarship? Each of the claimed divisions listed above has been critiqued, often ferociously and with good reason. However, there is also a compelling case to be made for the presence of a division. Strong examples come from numerous disciplines: from philosophy, work on ethics and aesthetics, in the Continental tradition, and on the problems of consciousness and free will; from psychology, work on decision making (prospect theory) and thinking styles; from neuroscience, work on the network structure of the brain.
In this class, we will be focused on asking the following questions: Is there a fundamental division in the mind? If so, what is the nature of the division? Why is it helpful to claim a division--what work does it do? How is it unhelpful? To what degree are apparent divisions products of culture and context, vs. biology? How might a scientific account of the division transform our understanding of historically influential divisions? How might historical and/or philosophical work inform current scientific research?

USSY,201,Mathematical Life and Death in the Ancient Greek World,3,"A seminar on the earliest mathematical proofs. The Greek Thales studied with Egyptian priests and gave the first geometric proof. Pythagoras went to Egypt, on Thales's advice, then founded a mathematical religious colony in Italy. Plato took much philosophy and mathematics from the Pythagoreans. Aristotle took only mathematics. Their arguments over mathematical science echoed in the world-city of Alexandria, where even slaves were encouraged to be scholars. There Euclid wrote the standard mathematics text for the next 2,000 years. The great Archimedes synthesized Platonic and Aristotelian conceptions. His mathematics inspired Galileo's and Newton's physics. His war machines inspired a Roman soldier to kill him on sight. A woman, Hypatia, later became the leading mathematician and Platonist philosopher of Alexandria and was torn to pieces by a mob for her pagan ideas. What did mathematics mean to these people? What can we learn about religious freedom, or about the science of war? Why do we all accept mathematics form 200 BC whole only specialist scholars remember the physics, biology, or religion of ancient Greece?

Fueled by political, social, and emotional reactions, his oeuvre was remarkable in every way.  From the early works, imitative of Haydn and Mozart, through his truly unique later compositions, Beethoven was revolutionary in his person and in his music.  The course will center around specific Beethoven masterworks which are being presented by University Circle Institutions, and student attendance at these concerts will be required.  Class sessions will involve discussions concerning the historical and cultural setting, influences, and analytic investigation into these masterworks.  Readings will be taken from Joseph Kaman and Alan Tyson (The New Grove Beethoven), Frida Knight (Beethoven and the Age of Revolution), and George Marek (Beethoven: Biography of a Genius).

USSY,229,Art Mirrors Art,3,"At the beginning of the Renaissance, about the year 1400, an important new theme arose in painting, sculpture and printmaking--the theme of art about art.  At a time when the status of artists in society was rising, new subjects began to appear in western European art that depicted both the artist and the process of making art.  Self portraits of artists, depictions of Saint Luke painting the Virgin Mary, images of women as artists and muses, classical and mythological stories of art making (Pygmalion and Galatea, Apelles painting the mistress of Alexander the Great), depictions of painting and sculpture studios and of art academies and instruction, scenes of art galleries and collections, still lifes about art, all reflected this new cultural interest in art as a topic in itself.  This seminar will look at individual works of art and subject types to understand what they tell us about the role of the arts and the changing status of the artist in the Renaissance and early modern period, up to the eve of the French Revolution, about 1789.  The works we study will thus be understood as symbolic indicators of social status and ideas about what art meant to European society.

The class will explore what we know of the self from historical, sociological, psychological, and philosophical perspectives.  We will examine how the meaning of the self has changed over time.  We will also explore where the self comes from, and the role of parents, peers and society in making a person who they are. Finally, we will explore how the self is defined for others, whether through an online presence, fashion choices, or the names that people prefer for themselves.  Specific topics will include Freud's view of the self as unavailable to consciousness, the importance and fallacy of high self-esteem, individualist and collective societies, and the ethics of self-presentation.  Students should expect to develop their critical thinking as well as writing and oral presentation skills through this class.

USSY,246,How to Make a Leader,3,"Leaders are both born and made.  Some seem to naturally know what to do and some need to study and practice to gain the necessary skills.  Both groups can be successful and it usually requires a combination of natural ability and effort to become the very best.  Leaders often point to role models as being important to the development of ""natural"" or acquired ability.  This course is appropriate for both those who are intellectually curious about leadership.  The course will be divided into three sections.  The first part will involve reading and discussions to explore and identify what leaders are like and what they do.  During the second part you will observe leaders in action and talk to them about what they think makes them successful.  Some examples of what you may observe will include a surgeon in the operating room (theater), a coach with his/her players, an executive in the board room, a concertmaster with his/her musicians and a judge in a courtroom.  The third part of the course will involve readings and discussions during which you will develop a personal approach to the level of leadership to which you aspire.

In this course we will not simply read ""funny books,"" but will examine a genre that is as unique as its many colorful protagonists: from Popeye to Superman, Wonder Woman to the X-men, comics have given us larger-than-life characters who are often caricatures of dominant (and sometimes subversive) American ideologies. We will learn not only the history of this unique genre, but will interrogate what it means to truly read comics artistically, politically, culturally, and symbolically. At heart, reading comics in an exercise in interpretation: given visual symbols, what meanings can we take from them? What can comics tell us? And how can we write about them in intelligent, critical ways? In this course we will learn to approach comics through critical thinking strategies; that is, questioning what they are, what they say, and where they come from.

Novels, films, and myths make significant contributions to the varied ways that people make sense of continents, nations, and other (often too conveniently used) geopolitical categories such and the East and West.  After considering the ways in which the European continent has been imagined over the centuries, we will explore texts and films that have contributed to the invention of East Central Europe and the Balkans and continue to shape our understanding of the eastern parts of Europe.  The class will include analyses of current news coverage of this area to unpack representations disseminated by the media and to reflect on the forces that aim to shape our understanding of geopolitical entities.  Ultimately, the course hopes to address geopolitical assumptions, evaluate cultural contexts, and help you think critically about the constructed nature of geopolitical categories.

USSY,284,The Art of Madness,3,"Taking a historical approach, this course will examine the relationship between the evolution of social and medical attitudes toward mental illness and fictional representations of madness in literature. Beginning with the early modern period, students will compare period sociological and medical narratives on mental illness to fiction works with representations of madness. In so doing, students will consider how the interactive dynamics of art and science contribute to cultural and social thought. Specific areas of inquiry will include: the development of psychology and its effect on societal perceptions of mental illness; cultural developments that occurred in response to changing perceptions of mental illness over the centuries; and the use of representational structures and narrative conventions in understanding and communicating the experience of mental illness. Other interrogations will include the imaginative function of mental illness in literature (e.g., melancholy's role in creativity); the cultural myths in iconography of mental illness in different historical periods; and ethical dilemmas regarding mental illness as reflected in both medical and literary narratives.

USSY,285V,Castaways and Cannibals: Stories of Empire,3,"Through a study of texts that exploit ""new world"" images like the castaway, the cannibal, the wild man, and the exotic woman, this course explores the ideologies that propelled nineteenth-century imperialism, particularly regarding the British in Australia and South Africa.  The class will consider how British settlers made ""homes"" in hostile and unfamiliar climates, how they addressed the problem of unfriendly and unequal contact with indigenous peoples, and how contemporary novelists reevaluate the historical past.  The course will work under the premise that contemporary geopolitical realities have been shaped by the imaginative work of British colonialists who, under the principle of terra nullius or ""no man's land,"" claimed the land and the resources of these southern territories and dismissed the very existence of the indigenous peoples that populated them.  The scope of the course will be broadly historical, exploring works that participated in British imperialism, as well as those that take a modern perspective.  Course materials will be drawn from a variety of genres, including fiction, poetry, film, ethnography, natural history, history, and criticism.  Ultimately, students will consider how narratives participate in the shaping of reality and of real-world relations of power.

To survive this world we need a vocabulary of criticism and authorship, a ""New Media Literacy"" that we can use to effectively and efficiently embrace our roles as both artist and critic.  This course explores a wide variety of New Media themes in both contemporary and historical contexts.  Students in the course will analyze their ever-evolving relationship to New Media as both viewers and creators.

USSY,286S,Shakesploitation of an Icon: Four Hundred Years of Shakespeare Marketing,3,"Following the interregnum in England, William Shakespeare began a long, sustained trajectory as a cultural icon, first in England, but eventually among all English-speaking cultures.  In the process, Shakespeare's works have been reinterpreted, adapted, re-contexted, commoditized, and re-purposed for the sake of art, educational relevance, and entertainment.  In the process, Shakespeare has often become the tool of unabashed commercialism, a practice which has come to be known as ""Shakesploitation.""  But why is Shakespeare's work so frequently purloined?  Why are out of context references to him so ubiquitous?  Why do people tend to equate the name of Shakespeare with qualities of genius?  Why have his works been continually adapted (often shamelessly) not only for the stage, but into other genres, including operas, paintings, novels and films?  How do we account for the proliferation of Shakespeare-based self-help books such as Shakespeare on Leadership?  Why is the infant stimulation video Baby Shakespeare a best-seller?  This course will explore these questions not only by reading a selection of Shakespeare's most enduring works, but also by examining criticism, adaptations, and marketing strategies that have been applied to Shakespeare's image and works over the last four centuries.

USSY,286U,Puzzled,3,"""Puzzled"" will look at the practice of puzzle making and puzzle-solving and explore the meaning of puzzles for different cultures throughout history.  We will read works from the disciplines of math, history, anthropology, philosophy, and literature.  We will explore why certain types of puzzles became popular and how puzzles have transferred from one culture to another. We will examine the role of code writing and code-breaking in the military and in the world of business.  We will read examples of fiction and watch films that adopt the form of the puzzle as a narrative device.  We will think about the function of puzzles as instruments to exercise the faculties of reason and logic and as a means of leisure or pleasant distraction.  

Students will be asked to both solve and create puzzles over the course of the semester.  They will write analytical essays on topics related to the practice and history of puzzle making and puzzle solving, and they will pursue a research topic that revolves around an issue or problem that has ""puzzled"" them.

USSY,286V,Food Craze: (No) Reservations,3,"The great number of food-related TV-shows indicate an unprecedented interest in questions about and fascination with food; in fact, these TV shows allure viewers with the appeal of a myth: eating involves discovery (Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, On the Road Again with Mario Batali, Planet Food), thrill (Bizarre Foods), or ""supernatural"" competition (Man vs. Food, Top Chef).  These television shows and food-related writings that accompany them in earnest ""worship"" food and often promote ideas of multiculturalism by which exciting and novel locales, foods, and meal preparatory techniques are discovered.  The objective of this course is to ""indulge"" in these shows and food writings and scrutinize them:  What explains such fascination with the viewing of and reading about food?  In what ways can food-exploration trips expand on ideas and critiques of multiculturalism and globalization?  What explains the centrality and ""mythical"" nature of food in the twenty-first century?  To begin these conversations, we will touch on a plethora of food writing works including works motivated by environmental and health concerns such as Michael Pollan's essays.  Then we look at the world of cookbooks (including the cookbooks of Julia Child and Rachel Ray), food blogs and TV-shows, and essays by Bill Buford and Calvin Trillin among many others.

USSY,287G,Shadowplay/East and West,3,"Shadows flicker across the screen, drawing us back to the precursors of the cinema and forward to digital effects.  To borrow Gorki's phrase, the cinema is truly a ""train of shadows.""  This course focuses on interactions between shadow theatre, dance, visual arts, the cinema, and traditional forms of play.  While the main focus is on traditional artistic forms, we also explore modern variants, including the use of shadows in contemporary photography.  We will look at shadows in different (yet overlapping) contexts, and compare the effects of still and moving shadows.  All of these contexts involve moments of narrative and silence.  Through a series of short papers which will be integrated into a longer paper, each student will explore his/her approach to a central question: What does it mean to play with shadows?

USSY,287M,Literature of 9/11,3,"Nearly 10 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, politicians, economists, artists, and educators continue to use the umbrella term ""post-9/11"" to describe our general cultural sensibility.  Yet, what does it mean, specifically, to live in a ""post-9/11"" America?  How have the cataclysmic events of that day altered our political and intellectual points of view?  In this course, we will explore these questions by considering how novelists, poets, and other writers have and continue to represent September 11th.  We will analyze techniques used to narrate the story of 9/11, investigating how American cultural values--or critiques of such values--influence the aesthetic choices that writers make.  Our course will begin chronologically at ""Ground Zero,"" as we examine representations of the immediate urban trauma while exploring the tensions between memorial and commemoration, spectacle and commercial pursuits.  We will then focus on works by both American and international authors addressing the days and months following the attacks.  We will examine how America is depicted with respect to its foreign policy and domestic politics, paying particular attention to the space of the ""home.""  In addition to novels, short fiction, and poetry, we will read cultural criticism and some philosophy.  Students will be given additional opportunities to explore film and other visual or new media representations of 9/11.

USSY,287T,King Arthur's Days and Knights,3,"Few legends have remained popular and vital as long as the story of King Arthur has.  Beginning with brief references in sixth-century histories, Arthur has risen again and again in medieval adventure stories, Victorian lyrics, and contemporary cinema.  Over thirty-five films, in fact, have depicted the adventures of the Round Table.  How can we explain this phenomenon?  To investigate this question, this seminar will trace the development of the legend from its oldest remaining written manifestations to the present day.  A chronological approach will allow us to see how Arthur's story accumulated new elements over time, including the famous love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere and the equally famous quest for the Holy Grail--neither of which appeared in the earliest versions of the story.  We will discuss topics such as what Arthur has represented at different periods in time and how his story changes when it is retold in different genres and media.  We will also consider how writers have adapted Round Table stories to suit political and social agendas.  Finally, to broaden our perspective we will spend a unit exploring legends from a variety of cultures and comparing their presentation of heroism.  Texts will include Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, pieces of Sir Thomas Malory's The Death of Arthur, the indispensable Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and portions of its new incarnation, Spamalot.

USSY,287X,Paris in the Arts,3,"Since the late eighteenth century, Paris has been a favorite subject for visual artists and writers alike, as well as the birthplace of several seminal artistic movements, such as Impressionism, Cubism, and the New Wave.  This course will use representations of Paris in the arts as lenses through which the identity and recent history of this major city will come into focus.  Further, stories, photographs, and films that stage the city of Paris and its people will also allow us to explore the broader relationship between art, the city, and the plight of modern man.  The course will include a wide range of artworks, from mid-nineteenth century photographs documenting the destruction of Medieval Paris and the advent of a rational capital, to stories chronicling the fate of hopeful newcomers, and films where the city is treated either as intimate landscape or impersonal grid.  The course will be both discussion based and writing intensive: students will be encouraged to envision class participation and writing assignments as means to analyze collaboratively, as well as individually, the material at hand.

USSY,288C,"Fly Fishing: the Sport, the Metaphysics, and the Literature",3,"According to WorldCat--the world's largest database of library content--the amount of literature on fly fishing dwarfs that of any other sport. What explains this interest? In this seminar, we will examine the appeal and cultural significance of fly fishing, especially as a site for understanding an individual's relationship to the natural world. We will read both fiction and non-fiction works that will help us explore the fundamental nature of sport, how it varies from other forms of recreation, and whether sport can be considered art. We will also investigate what prompts authors to imbue fly fishing with metaphysical, spiritual, or aesthetic dimensions. And we will study how the intent and style of such works differ from traditional academic research writing, as well as how those elements of craft might be integrated into an effective academic writing style. We will also learn by experiencing some of the sport's skills, including fly tying and casting.

USSY,288E,Fantastic Voyages: The Journey in the Ancient and Medieval World,3,"When we make a record of a journey to an unfamiliar place (regardless of whether or not we really went there), we are framing difference.  On the one hand, we create a record of what we see and experience, while on the other, we reveal our own cultural standpoint based on how we represent that experience.  In this seminar, students will read a selection of narratives from antiquity to the late medieval era that purport to depict a ""real"" journey into the unknown, with the intent of examining how the representation of different cultures by the traveler, whether real or imaginary, shapes and defines cultural boundaries.  Our focus will be on journeys within the cultures of the Mediterranean and Europe (including Britain), and will include texts from Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Western travelers.  Students will consider the texts in relation to their context and audience, evaluate the authority of the author's account using primary source material, and draw on subsequent scholarship.  By undertaking a symbolic journey through the eyes of different travelers, students will learn not only to examine texts from several perspectives, but also to recognize the ways in which cultural differences and ""otherness"" are constructed.  We will begin with the concept of the journey in the ancient world, particularly how different cultures traveled and how their mode of transport (horse, boat, foot) and mode of living (nomadic, sedentary) influenced their perception of the people they encountered.  As we move from antiquity into the medieval era, we will trace how religious, political, and economic changes influenced representations of other cultures.  In addition to written texts, we will study visual references, including illustrations based on the seminar's required texts as well as early maps.

USSY,288I,Diversions: Experimental Stories and New Media,3,"In this course, students will study works in which the authors and artists have experimented with traditional linear forms and created stories that are, for instance, labyrinthine, framed, collaged, geometrical, digressive, and even networked. While both print-based and digital texts offer spaces for diverse and deeply engaging written or visual performances, they also require further critical inquiry into the ways in which they create, reflect, or resist social and cultural values. Our focus in this course will be exploring how stories (and other texts) - in print, on screen, on canvas, in digital formats - that don't follow or that play with conventional rules of order encourage us to participate in making sense of our contemporary world. 

The goals of the course include: exploring the relationship between form and content in written and visual productions, developing a critical perspective from which to enjoy, assess, and respond creatively to traditional print and multimedia presentations, and making excellent use of research resources at CWRU and cultural resources at University Circle. In addition, students will work to develop their writing and presentation skills and to innovate novel models of research writing.

USSY,288J,Cultural Representations of Violence,3,"The twentieth century was arguably the most violent in human history.  That legacy has carried into our own time: from 9/11 to school shootings to the recent conflict in Libya, violence surrounds us.  But what exactly is violence?  How is it that we all recognize it when we see it?  How do we represent it to ourselves?  Most importantly, how do we make sense of it?  Can we make sense of it?  This class will explore these questions by studying the uneasy role violence plays in literature, film, performance art, and other cultural productions.  As we do so, we will consider two central and potentially conflicting ideas.  On the one hand, violence tends to resist our abilities to represent it; any depiction seems somehow inadequate to the real thing.  At the same time, representations of violence surround us constantly, and for any number of political, cultural, and social reasons.  Thus, violence in modern and contemporary culture is paradoxical, both permeating and resisting our imaginations.  Through class discussions, written responses, presentations, and independent research projects, we will explore these and other ideas, considering how art attempts to comprehend violence and how artistic representations of violence relate to (implicate?) their audience.  Although our focus will be largely on art, and primarily literature, our approach will be necessarily interdisciplinary.  Be prepared to weigh in on topics as diverse as politics, aesthetics, philosophy, gender and sexuality, war, trauma, and colonialism.  Undoubtedly, violence can be a painful subject, but the goal of our seminar is to pursue a rigorous intellectual and imaginative inquiry into one of the most pressing topics of our time.

USSY,288R,Cultural and Ethical Issues in American-Chinese Business Relations,3,"The American and Chinese economies are the two biggest economies in the world.  The Chinese economy is the fastest growing large economy in the world.  The dynamic American economy is unique in its combination of large multinational enterprises and small entrepreneurial firms.  The American economy is characterized by a vast private sector, the rule of law, and the largest private capital markets in the world.  The Chinese economy is 30 years into a period of reform from communist industrial organization to ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"", which includes a significant role for the private sector.  The Chinese economy is still an experiment.  The established American business system exists within a democratic political system, where corporate lobbying has a significant influence on the creation of laws and government policy.  The Chinese economy is still under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party, a one-party dictatorship.

When Americans go to China to do business, they find the cultural, social, political, and moral systems vastly different than what they are familiar with.  Transparency International Ranks China 27 out of 28 of the most corrupt large economies in the world.  In China, bribery of government officials and kickbacks to sales and purchasing managers is common.  Key questions we will investigate are: 
1. In what ways are the two business systems similar and different? 
2.What is the nature of Chinese social relations?  How do they differ from American social relations?  What effect do they have on business?
3. What is the nature of the Chinese political system?  What impact does it have on business in China?
4. How do American business people negotiate the Chinese business system?

USSY,288V,"Seclusion, Gender and the Exotic: Imagining the Harem",3,"When the term ""harem"" is invoked, the first image that comes to mind is of scantily clad women living in sequestered opulence in some exotic, yet vaguely ""Eastern"" place. This image has been reproduced and perpetuated through art, literature and music to the degree that even today, familiar themes of seduction, passivity and mystery related to the harem can be found throughout popular culture.

Historically, gender segregation reaches into antiquity and existed in a variety of forms, cross-culturally. The term ""harem"" was not used regularly until the 13th century, and then only referred to the specific form of gender segregation used by the Ottoman court. Application of the word ""harem"" to all women's quarters in other cultures was the result of European contact with the Ottoman Empire, despite the fact that other cultures often had their own, distinct, terminology for women's spaces.

In this seminar, we will explore the history and practice of gender segregation as a means to examine how the idea of the harem was constructed in the Eastern and Western imagination. Under what circumstances did women live separately? How were gendered spaces created, justified and maintained? Where did our image of the harem come from? Using primary and secondary sources, we will examine a selection of histories and representations of the harem in literature, slave and travel narratives, and religion. As the Western idea of the harem is part of what Edward Said theorized as ""Orientalism"", we will explore Said's theory as well as subsequent theories related to gender and the exotic. In addition, we will look at images of women's quarters from antiquity to the present and listen to representations of the exotic in music. Our goal is not only to study the historical fact of the harem, but also to engage issues related to gender, the exotic and representation from different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

USSY,288W,A History of Noise: Music and Politics from Beethoven to Jimi Hendrix,3,"This writing-intensive course examines the roles that noise has played in political discourses throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Its charged bookends--Beethoven and Jimi Hendrix-- invite students to challenge supposed differences between ""Art"" and popular music and examine relationships between music and society. ""Who does 'Art' serve?,"" ""Is it possible to distinguish between 'Art' and noise?,"" and ""Is sound capable of influence at all?"" are among the chief questions this course explores. The curriculum's historical breadth allows students to consider these larger questions through a variety of case studies, including (among others) the bombast and nationalism of Beethoven's ninth symphony; the Marxist-inspired ""emancipation"" of sound, as presented by Arnold Schoenberg; the gender-bending metal of Eddie Van Halen; and the protest-by-distortion of Hendrix's national anthem at Woodstock. By the end of this course, students will gain more awareness of the ways in which the music surrounding them seeks to shape society.

USSY,288Y,Shots in the Dark: Investigating Crime Films,3,"Crime movies and their subgenres (Gangster, film noir, detective, police) are the most enduringly popular of all Hollywood genres.  They've been around since the silent era and attest to America's fascination with crime.  But another reason we are so attracted to crime films stems from a pair of contradictory narrative projects that underline the genre.  On the one hand, these films valorize the distinctions between the genre's stock characters--criminal, victim and avenger--in order to affirm the social, moral or institutional order.  On the other hand, crime movies explore the relations between the three roles in order to mount a critique that challenges that order.  In addition to emphasizing film studies, we will study the films for what they say about crime, criminals and criminal law.

As most crime films contain an investigation, so too will the organization of the course.  There are methods for analyzing film just as there are methods for investigating a crime scene.  Investigation requires identifying, collecting, analyzing and interpreting evidence.  We'll start by investigating what makes the genre so enduring--its mise-en-scene, intent or characters?  You will be reporting your findings in three scholarly papers: a formal analysis on a specific film, a sociological analysis of a specific film and a research paper with documentation.

USSY,289A,Do We Have Free Will?,3,"Concepts such as freedom, choice, moral responsibility, and autonomy are commonly invoked to describe our sense, as human beings, that our actions and thoughts are really our own. This seems like experiential commonsense-when I choose to read a novel instead of a philosophy text it feels like the decision to do so was made by me, that there was no coercion, or other seen or unseen force, that intervened to make me choose as I did. We extend this logic to the judgment of moral and legal responsibility. If you engage in good behavior, you get the praise; if you do bad things, you are blameworthy.

 Despite our self-perception that we freely make decisions and choose our actions, we sometimes invoke the notion that certain events are the result of some prior cause or circumstance that determines what occurs in the present. In this instance, we do not appear to be fully free in our choices because we cannot undo the causes that dictate what is taking place here and now. To the extent that we experience current actions as having a cause in the past, we are flirting with the idea that our behavior is not wholly free, but determined or conditioned by what has come before. Determinism, necessity, fate, destiny, predestination: these are terms typically used to describe the sense that our actions and thoughts are the result of unknown forces or circumstances beyond our control.

 This course uses classic and contemporary texts, taken from multiple cultural traditions, to explore the problem of free will and related issues of body/mind dualism and personal identity. Although the term ""free will"" does not appear in all cultural contexts, found everywhere are questions of whether we are free to act and think as we wish or whether our thoughts and actions are in some way determined. We also read science fiction short stories as thought experiments in order to help us understand the ramifications of various positions on free will and related problems.

 This course is discussion-based and writing-intensive. Classes focus on analysis and interpretation of texts and ideas.

USSY,289E,Poets of Ohio,3,"More often than not, contemporary society views poetry as a strange and dated art form. When the genre actually does receive recognition, it is usually under the guise of Hip-Hop or Slam Poetry. While both of those offshoots contain their own poetic and artistic merit, this course intends to familiarize you with contemporary, literary poetry and highlight the dynamic poetry community of Ohio. Luckily for us, many of the poets we will read during the course agreed to visit our class this semester to talk about their work and read their poems.
In addition to demonstrating that poetry is alive, well, and thriving all around us, we will also attempt to think critically about this genre. Why do poetic texts, both of the present and the past, seem so difficult to read and understand? What writing techniques, strategies, and styles do poets use that make comprehending their work such a challenge? More importantly, why would anyone choose to write in this manner? Through close readings of the primary texts, researching the historical and literary contexts surrounding contemporary poetry, and discussing the art form with each other (as well as with the poets themselves), we will come to a better understanding of how these texts function.
To this extent, our course will engage the symbolic world as we explore the local and national poetry communities, noting how writers found relationships upon geography, aesthetics, and demographics (just to name a few), using written texts to express some emotion, thought, or identity. In order to accomplish these goals, we will read, participate in class discussions, and write extensively about poetry composed by contemporary Ohio poets. Therefore, you will be expected to engage our course texts critically, thinking through the manner in which language operates as a tool for generating and sustaining, as well as undermining, community formation.

To explore this question, we will study a wide range of writings and other cultural productions.  The first part of the course will examine classic and contemporary texts about city life from urban studies, history, philosophy, and geography, among other fields.  These texts will provide useful frameworks and insights for the second part of the course, where we will analyze contemporary cultural productions that offer their own intriguing urban visions, including fiction, poetry, film, and music.  We will analyze how these texts suggest ways of both reading/interpreting and writing/rewriting the city.

USSY,289G,The American West on Film,3,"Few geographical areas in the United States contain as many tall tales and mythological figures as the American frontier. From an extreme point of view, the West is the only American myth because no other nation can claim the cowboy, the Native American, or the immigrant worker on the transcontinental railroad. And yet, each of these figures remains spectacularly diverse. We celebrate their variety and lionize their individuality in film, popular novels, and cultural criticism. From the visions of the New World to the conquest of the frontier, the color of the American West proliferates and transforms, defining our culture.  In this course, we will investigate how critics have understood our fascination with the Western frontier. The class will broadly explore version of the frontier in novels, films, and historical accounts.  Reading about the history of the actual west, the course will then examine how the films of the twentieth century alter history in order to express the fantasies and anxieties of their own time.  By studying both history and film, we will be able to interrogate manifest destiny and the myth of American exceptionalism. What makes the West such an integral part of our understanding of America? How has its actual history become myth?  What does the American fascination with the cowboy, the Native American, or the outlaw imply about our nation?

USSY,289I,The Art of Science,3,"This is an interdisciplinary course that will explore the intersection between two disparate but often-connected fields, the history of art and the history of science.  Although these fields are separated on college campuses today, they share a history that is united by a common philosophical question: how do we evaluate and know the world around us?  The documentation of that knowledge is often visual--whether written or painted, tabulated or carved--images play an essential role in the shaping and recording of information. Beginning with the Renaissance revival of Pliny's Natural History (c. 77-79 BCE) this class will focus on the complex ways in which science and art overlap and enrich one another. Topics explored in this course include: mathematical theory and linear perspective; anatomical dissection and naturalism in figure painting; optics, lenses, and realism; Copernicus, Galileo and religious painting; botany and scientific illustration; natural history and fine art collecting, etc. Classes will be supplemented by visits to the Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Dittrick Museum of Medical History.

USSY,289J,Beauty Myths Today,3,"Published just over 20 years ago, Naomi Wolf's influential study ""The Beauty Myth"" significantly influenced popular thinking about body image.  Analyzing both cultural trends and empirical data, Wolf argued that as women made unprecedented advances in public life in the latter half of the 20th century, they were at the same time held to increasingly unrealistic standards of physical beauty.  Wolf's study not only contributed to extant analyses of sexism in the media, but also introduced to mainstream readers the politics of the representation of women's bodies in popular culture.  This course will examine to what extent Wolf's original claim hold true today.  In other words, what physical standards must one meet in order to be considered professionally and personally successful?  In exploring this question, we will look at the origins and current workings of the American beauty industry, considering the changing representation of the ideal body throughout the 20th century.  We'll read texts by historians, philosophers, novelists, poets, cultural critics, and journalists who examine the politics of beauty. To both (re-)define and trace the continuing effects of beauty myths in the 21st century, we'll consider the rhetoric of ideal womanhood as it shows up in popular texts such as websites promoting anorexia, TV shows about plastic surgery, diet books, magazines, and guides for mothers.  Students will have opportunities to define the beauty myth more broadly, exploring its effects on men and its mediating presence in other cultural sites.

USSY,289Y,Reading and Writing Biography,3,"The study and practice of biography, that is, writing about someone's life, is an important tool for understanding how meaning is constructed. In this class, we will learn some of the history of biography and what it hopes to accomplish in its various sub-genres. Why are biographies so popular? Why are we so interested in them? What do they do? Is it possible to perfectly represent an objective truth of someone or does the discussion of someone else's life require a more symbolic interpretation of things? We will engage in reading and discussing some important and contemporary biographies in a variety of styles and genres from autobiography to works of near-fiction. We will learn how researchers use facts to construct more symbolic narratives around an argument that tells a story about someone's life in a way that engages with important issues of self, audience, and the location of truth. As our final research project, we will undertake our own biographical projects where we will do primary research in order to construct focused narratives of people of our own choosing. To work up to this point, we will work on our own autobiographies, look at the lives of things, and look at some films which foreground the narrative of life. This course will be of great use to writers and researchers who must be able to communicate by any kind of true account in a way that is both engaging and comprehensive.

The seminar's goal will be to inspire critical thinking by confronting our fascination with things expanding and contracting, growing and shrinking, things speeded up and things slowed down.  We will approach the subject from a variety of disciplines - cultural history, psychology, mathematics, philosophy, literature, economics, and the sciences - with the intention of unpacking both the topic itself and the tools that we use to explain our world.  We will ask questions about why we find gigantism and dwarfism unsettling; how we define ugliness and beauty; how we understand the odds and statistics of horrific or wonderful things happening to us; and how this determines our behavior.  After examining theory and examples of things ""out of proportion"", students will produce a research project that combines primary and secondary sources and will make an argument in behalf of an example that they find compelling.

USSY,290N,Django Chained,3,"To gain a better understanding of the experience and history of slavery from the perspective of the enslaved, we will read the works of Octavia Butler. She knew that the problem with the historical narrative was that slaves did not write it. As a science fiction and fantasy author, Butler spent her career giving voice to the enslaved by recovering their experience and exposing it to the reader through the lens of imagined and symbolic worlds. By reading her work, we will come to understand a different way of viewing history. We will join the historical narrative with the science fiction narrative to arrive at a deeper understanding of the human experience with subjugation and oppression. The class readings will have time travel, vampires, and aliens. However, the most frightening monsters of all will be human.

USSY,290O,Everyone's a Critic! The Play,3,"Have you ever been to a play and afterwards said to someone, ""That was terrible!"", or hopefully, ""That was incredible!"" but found yourself unable to clearly communicate what made it good or bad?  In theater, word of mouth is the best advertising and your words have the power to make or break a production. This course will examine the role of ""audience as critic,"" as well as the role of the professional critic, and the influence each has on the success of live theater.  The student will learn critical skills that will allow them to clearly identify what made a particular production a rousing success, or a dismal failure.  The student will learn the process by which actors, directors and designers bring a play to life, and the analytical skills a critic uses to either keep the play alive, or bring it to an untimely end.  The student will have the opportunity to see live productions of the plays we will discuss in class.  The student will be required to attend at least five theatrical productions over the course of the semester at CWRU's Eldred Theater, the CWRU/CPH MFA collaboration, The Cleveland Playhouse, and other local theaters.  We will compare and contrast these productions with past productions at other regional theaters and on Broadway.  Actors, directors and designers of these local productions will come to class to discuss their process and defend their artistic choices.  We will speak with local, professional theater critics and discuss their praises, and their pans! With the skills learned in this class the student will have the power to help a theater sell out every show, or force them to close the doors forever!

USSY,290Q,Great Nineteenth-Century Novels:  A Close Look at Some Masterpieces of Continental Fiction,3,"The form and nature of the novel has changed a lot since the nineteenth-century. There's been the modern novel, the post-modern novel, the experimental novel, the graphic novel, and who knows what's coming next? This course is about what the continental novel was like in the nineteenth-century, the Golden Age of the genre. Its major premise is that you don't have to be a literature major to read, enjoy, and profit from the old-style classic novels. We will read novels by Balzac, Flaubert, Turgenev, and Tolstoy in modern translations, and we will take our time with them, looking closely at the component parts: narrator, plot, setting, character, dialogue, where the meaning comes from. The course offers, in part, obviously, a chance to read some of the great European novels of the nineteenth-century. It also provides a chance to go at a slow enough pace to allow time to study and discuss in detail the techniques these masters of the novel used so brilliantly. Students who complete the course, therefore, will become both familiar with classic texts and more knowledgeable and skillful readers of any and all narrative fiction.

USSY,290T,Media Responses to 9/11,3,"For a generation of Americans, 9/11 was a defining event, the kind that slices life into before and after.  The reverberations of that singular event continue to dominate our lives today, in ways we can readily recognize, and in ways that we cannot.  In this class, we will examine how the discourse around 9/11 has shifted over the course of a decade, from the urgency of screaming newspaper headlines the day after, to the more elegiac responses shaped by novels and films over the years.  We will also examine how different media--from graphic novels to films to novels--have responded to the same event and how these responses have shaped, and continue to shape, our collective narrative about the meaning of that event.

USSY,290U,Poetry for People Who Hate Poetry,3,"You don't hate it. In fact, you probably already love poetry, even if you don't know it. You might copy moody indie rock lyrics into your journal or quote the rhymes in a rap verse to your friends. You might hum advertising jingles to yourself; you speak in slang and think in metaphor. Why do we tend to treat only some of these instances of figurative language as poems? Is there a difference between poems and poetry? What can our individual attitudes about poetry reveal about what and whom we value on a cultural scale? In this course we will ask these and other questions about our collective love/hate relationship with poetry. All of this attention to how poems and poetry work will help us understand how our own writing should work.  This course also focuses on the development of independent research skills and the creation of complex, analytic, well-supported arguments. We will write in a variety of lengths and genres; our reading and research will culminate in a project challenging students to compile an anthology of essential ""poetry"" with a critical introduction.

USSY,290V,Experiencing Mathematics,3,"You've studied mathematics, but have you really experienced it? In Love and Math, author and mathematician Edward Frenkel says that, for him, the experience is tantamount to love. Acknowledging that his field suffers from the reputation of being dry and inaccessible, he challenges this negative view by sharing the passion, beauty, and adventure from his career as one of the leading researchers in the groundbreaking Langlands program, the so-called grand unified theory of mathematics. Like Frenkel, we will discuss the appreciation and enjoyment of mathematics. Furthermore, we will consider other ways in which it is useful and interesting to talk about ""experiencing mathematics.""  The question of what that phrase means is central to the approach we will take toward the various topics covered in class. We will examine cultural attitudes toward mathematicians and mathematics. Similarly, we will investigate the culture of mathematicians themselves, with particular attention to their ideas about community, collaboration, fairness, and merit. We will also look at the ways, from Big Data to high fashion, that the work of mathematicians actively shapes contemporary society. In addition, we will practice problem-solving techniques for contest mathematics; this activity requires no more than a pre-calculus background. You will not be graded on mathematical problems. Instead, you will reflect on your own problem-solving process.

USSY,290Y,Ecotopia: Imagining the Future,3,"The present environmental crisis has given rise to diverse imaginative visions of the future. Dystopian novelists and directors have created texts that portray a disastrous future in which humanity refuses to deal with global warming, ocean acidification, and overpopulation. For writers like Aldous Huxley, the future involves a grim vision of a depleted Earth and a human population under threat from its own political madness. Alternatively, writers and filmmakers have imagined hopeful visions of a human future in which we collectively remake society in order to live in harmony with nature. Although dystopian thinkers far outnumber utopians, we will investigate both visions of the future.  More specifically, we will examine these possible futures as ways of thinking about the inter-generational ethical obligation that we have to leave behind positive and sustainable conditions for future generations living on Earth.  This seminar will tackle that challenge by analyzing ecotopian visions of the planet's future and by defining ways of creating a sustainable society. Possible novels and films include Brave New World, Ecotopia, The Road, Snowpiercer, Cloud Atlas, and Oryx and Crake.

USSY,291B,Science (Fiction) Dystopias,3,"In 1927 the German science fiction classic Metropolis showed filmgoers a mechanized dystopian nightmare in which humans took on the roles of cogs and levers in a giant machine. Years later, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four depicted a totalitarian regime reshaping post-war England in a similar way, using surveillance and repetitive activities to turn the population into something less than human. Appropriating science fiction motifs, dystopian narratives have forced us to reconsider how science and technology are used to complicate and at times augment our notion of what it means to be a social animal. In this class, we will consider a range of texts, including novels, short stories, films, and comic books, to explore the interaction between people and the things that they invent. The first half of the course will emphasize traditional utopian texts and readings will include selections from works like Margaret Cavendish's Blazing World (biological utopia), Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (mathematical dystopia), and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (technological dystopia). During the second half of the semester we will discuss utopian and dystopian worlds in popular fiction and film, such as science fiction short stories by Harlan Ellison, Alan Moore's V for Vendetta, and Wall-E, to consider how the utopia/dystopia changed in the latter half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century.

USSY,291F,Literary Arcadias: Idealized Landscapes and the Intrusion of Reality,3,"The literary genre of pastoral has long depicted the simplicity of life in a natural environment--a place situated at a time before environmental exploitation, colonization, and urbanization.  These pastoral retreats are often given the generic name ""Arcadia."" As many critics and authors have noted, however, literary depictions of Arcadia often expose the delicate balance of conflicting realities: peace and war, rich and poor, rural and urban.  In this seminar, we will investigate what happens when external reality disrupts Arcadia's Edenic space.  Is the creation of these idyllic settings a way of masking the disturbing realities of class inequality, political power, and environmental degradation?  Or are authors attempting to articulate an alternative to them?  As part of our investigation, we will consider how the pastoral genre has evolved over time, noting especially how depictions of Arcadia have responded to various cultural, commercial, and political changes. We will also examine how the idea of Arcadia shapes contemporary culture and our own understanding of the relationship between nature and society in the modern world.

USSY,291G,"Revenge, Violence, and Laughter: From Shakespeare to Tarantino",3,"Why do laughter and revenge so often go hand in hand? In the third act of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, the play's title character, shortly after learning of several acts of grotesque violence enacted on his family - including the rape of his daughter and the killing of his sons - laughs uncontrollably.  When asked why he's laughing, Titus gives two reasons.  First, he says he has ""Not another tear to shed,"" and second, he says it's because continuing to cry would keep him from taking revenge on his enemies.  This course will explore a series of artistic works where characters are victims and perpetrators of extraordinary acts of violence and injustice, and the response--either from the characters themselves or the audience--includes a grotesque laughter.  We'll explore the reasons for this odd conjunction of laughter and revenge, asking the following questions: What is the relationship between pleasure and laughter on the one hand, and justice and revenge on the other?  Is revenge, despite its violence, something to be cheered rather than mourned? Can laughter, as Titus suggests, help correct and fight injustice, where tears do not?  Where is the line between an upright pleasure at justice being done and a sadistic enjoyment of suffering (even when those suffering are wicked)?  Is artistic violence, when exaggerated or extreme, ridiculous rather than shocking? Class discussion will focus on the formal, ethical and social implications of art and literature.  This is to say, we will not only discuss how authors get audiences to laugh at murder and dismemberment, but also the political and ethical results of inviting laughter at things like violence against women, genocide, and capital punishment.

USSY,291H,From Dr,Seuss to Wild Things: Radical Children's,"What is the first book you remember reading? For most people, their earliest memories are tied to picture books that were read to them or that they encountered in grade school. These books not only introduce children to basic skills, but also to their culture's belief systems. In this course, we will take seemingly simplistic picture books, including Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat"" and David Wiesner's ""The Three Pigs"" and analyze the underlying messages and the ""hidden adult"" present in their illustrations and text. We will engage with different theoretical approaches towards children's literature, including visual rhetoric, race studies, and adaptation theory, as we analyze their pictures and prose and the history of American children's literature. The key questions we will explore and answer together include: What is ""children's literature?""  What assumptions are made about the readers of these books? What function do the adult producers/purchasers/distributors of these books serve in the creation and circulation of these texts? How does adaptation and transmission of cultural beliefs affect the reader's reaction to picture books?

USSY,291J,Improvisation in Jazz and Beyond,3,"On the surface it might seem that a jazz concert, a medical procedure, and a religious sermon have little in common, but this course examines how all three in fact share certain significant traits.  One of these traits is improvisation--the ability of a performer to respond to unanticipated stimuli and create something new. Another trait is the tension between specialization and integration that develops whenever a highly-trained expert performs with or for non-experts, as in the exchange between musicians and audience, doctors and patients, or clergy and congregants. To answer these questions, we will attend jazz concerts, medical lectures, and church services.

USSY,291K,Risk and Decision Making:  Fundamental Concepts and Practices,3,"Risk is everywhere.  Some risks are visible and can have potentially significant consequences, such as committing a felony or choosing a life partner.  Other risks can have equally serious consequences, but might not be so evident:  eating breakfast cereal made from genetically modified crops or ignoring that funny-shaped mole on your shoulder, for example.  Sometimes we take risks in situations where we have a lot of control, like deciding to jaywalk when there is no traffic; other times we face risk where we have little control, like choosing a major without being able to predict whether there will be any jobs in that field by the time you graduate.  How do we decide what risks are worth taking?  Are some methods for assessing risk better than others?  How can a better understanding of risk help us improve our decision making, both at the individual and public policy levels?  In this course, we will use simple conceptual frameworks from decision theory and behavioral research to show how we measure risk.  We will also examine how scientists combine historical records, scientific theories, probability, and expert judgment to assess risk.  In addition, we will ask students to respond some of the well-known logical paradoxes, and explain the meaning if their decisions. Finally, we will apply what we learn about risk to a variety of examples from the fields of health, public safety, environmental studies, manufacturing/industrial processes, systems sciences, and finance.

USSY,291Q,P,R,"Is it reality or is it spin? We all know the terms--""it's spin,"" ""it's P.R.,"" ""he's a flack""--and none of them are said kindly. Yet, over the past century public relations has become an often invisible multi-billion dollar manipulation of our collective perception of reality. Sometimes this manipulation is benign. But just as often it can weaken our democracy through weapons of words, images, and argument.  This seminar will explore the origins and consequences of this silent, symbolic revolution. We will look at the uses of P.R. today in business, politics, and popular culture; examine the tools used to construct and sell those perceptions; and look into the values underlying these activities. We will do so through both academic and media materials, as well as through writing, research, and discussion.  All of these are intended to deepen your critical thinking and writing skills, and build your research, discussion, and oral presentation strengths.  Students who have received credit for USSO 260 may not receive credit for this course.

USSY,291T,"Demystifying the Guerilla Fighter: Imperialism, Race, and Revolution in Latin America",3,"The image of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara is embossed in many a t-shirt, poster, and bumper sticker across college campuses. Guevara's writings and, more specifically, select catchy quotes, also have circulated in websites and popular films for the last couple of decades.  In this course we will examine the myths surrounding men like Guevara by tracing the history of conquistadores, nuns, mystics, insurgents, and revolutionaries in Latin America from the colonial to the modern period. Toward this goal we will look at an array of personal letters, diary entries, government documents, religious texts, essays, prose, and works of literature written by women and men who viewed themselves, and were viewed by others, as speaking to, or ushering in, transformative change. As a class we will also examine the connections between imperial projects and calls for action in colonial and early modern Latin America and the Caribbean, explore the relationships between slavery, gender norms, and capitalism, and assess the changing nature of what freedom, reform, and revolution meant to various actors from the late eighteenth century to the late twentieth century. Indeed, our end goal as a class is to map out what some of our assumptions have been regarding what it means to be a guerilla fighter, connect it to how calls for change have manifested themselves across time, unearth the ironies and allure of radical frameworks, and investigate what this understanding can do for us as we tackle questions of change and possibility.

USSY,291W,"""Never Such Innocence Again"":  World War I in Literature and Culture",3,"As cities around the globe mark the centennial of World War I (1914-1918), this seminar will explore the relationship between that watershed moment and the varieties of literature and art it inspired. In what ways did ""the Great War"" shape the direction of twentieth-century culture? How was language itself altered, as new vocabularies emerged (e.g., ""shell-shock,"" ""the home front"") and previously venerable terms such as ""honor"" and ""sacrifice"" acquired radically different connotations? What strategies did writers and artists evolve in order to contend with the magnitude of the conflict and its unprecedented human cost? Assessing the war's impact on Western thought, the poet Philip Larkin famously wrote, ""Never such innocence again""--yet this loss of innocence also coincided with the birth of new forms of literary and artistic expression. In this course we will discuss and write about such innovations as they occurred in the visual arts--painting, sculpture, film--and in literary works by Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, and other writers who used the resources of imaginative literature to grapple with the Great War and its consequences.

USSY,291Z,Marriage Plots,3,"Why do so many stories end with a wedding? Our course will consider the form of the marriage plot: we will look at how stories often begin with young(ish) people meeting and falling in love, and how the process of storytelling denies (or frustrates) their initial connection. Through the telling of the story, however, the young lovers overcome obstacles in myriad forms: controlling parents, financial insecurity or class differences, religious difference, even magical spells. We will think about what these stories do for their readers and viewers. We will also think about how various other stories--of riots, of government, of dissatisfaction with life--get couched in marriage plots. What is it about a marriage plot that ensures stability, satisfies our desires, and gives us such necessary closure? How does the form of ""comedy""--for this is the overarching genre that relies so heavily upon marriage plots--work with and reshape the marriage plot over time? We'll also briefly ponder how supporters of marriage equality have used the marriage plot. Finally, our investigation into the marriage plot will look at marriage plot comedies that refuse to conform to the typical marriage plot: dark humor from a novel like Villette to films like Harold and Maude or The War of the Roses. This course investigates the presence of the marriage plot across multiple literary genres: dramas, novels, film, and television. We will also read and view courtship narratives from across historical periods from the Renaissance until today.

USSY,292A,Drama and Social Protest Movements,3,"The complicated relationship between drama and politics dates back to at least ancient Greece. Today, playwrights continue to use political conflict as the basis for dramatic action, as well as use their plays to spark political protest--at times even risking imprisonment or exile. In this course, we will read a collection of protest plays alongside accounts of the protest movements that the plays and playwrights either depicted or participated in. As part of our investigation, we will ask the following questions:  What do these plays tell us about the performative and emotional work done by protest?  What role does theatricality play in the acts of persuasion, criticism, and direct action normally associated with political protest? Do these plays simply reproduce the goals and criticisms of protest movements, or does drama invite a style of social critique that sets it apart from other forms of political speech?  Do these plays present protest as focused on the personal grievances of characters, or do they criticize larger social systems like class, gender, and racial hierarchy?  We will also spend some class time discussing a few more modern anti-war, anti-racist and feminist protest movements, exploring the aesthetics and theatricality of protest and the extent to which they further political change.

USSY,292C,The Moral Suspicion of Money,3,"Money is morally suspicious--the root of all sorts of evil. This suspicion isn't merely that bad people do bad things with money; it is that somehow the use of money helps make otherwise good people bad. But money is everywhere, pervasive and practical, and so a technology we both need and distrust. Money prices give us reasons when deciding what to do. But we think that money often gives us ""good"" reasons to do bad things and bad reasons to do good things. And sometimes assigning certain things monetary values at all seems unreasonable. We use money to express our values, yet complain money often distorts them, or has become a value itself. We use money to relate to each other in mutually beneficial commerce and trade, but worry that money degrades our relations.

In this interdisciplinary course we'll investigate the birth of both money and the idea of its badness. We'll survey history, literature, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, film, and the day's news for culturally varied expressions of, and reactions to, this suspicion. We'll first ask, ""What is money?"" (""How do things like rocks, metals, shells, or data-bits become, and continue to be, money?"") and ""What is morality?"" (""What might we mean when we claim some act, person, situation, or system is morally better or worse?""). We'll then consider specific suspicions and morally evaluate them, along the way raising questions such as: Why can I rent myself out as a landscaper but not as a prostitute? Is the Iranian kidney market better than U.S. waiting lists, or ""bio-violence?"" Should Americans with slave ancestors be paid for their family past? Is there a moral difference between a corporate raider and a pirate? What is Aristotle's explanation for why Capitalists often produce crap? Why might Nietzsche think Wall Street's Gordon Gekko might be right that ""greed is good?? What does Marx mean when he claims money-driven markets are ""alienating?"" If money expresses our values, ought anything be above money? Is anything beyond price?

USSY,292I,The Cinema of Otherness,3,"One way that humans understand themselves is to consider some counterpart entity--an Other--against which the Self can be understood.  This Other, though perhaps based on knowledge of a real person or people, is always shaped by the Self's projected fears and desires.  At a cultural level, these projections result in generally held stereotypes that the powerful use to maintain their superior position in a hierarchical relationship.  Movies are one place where stereotypes of the Other are created and maintained.  Movies shape how we see, think and feel toward the Other.  In this course, we will attempt to understand how film manufactures Otherness by studying several key Hollywood movies.  We will examine their use of racial and ethnic categories of Otherness, as well as how they position the viewing Self as white. We will also examine other sites of difference, such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, bodily disfigurement, paying special attention to symbolic representations of these differences in the form of robots, monsters and aliens.

USSY,292K,21st Century American Theater,3,"With its roots tracing back to Ancient Greece, theater is one of our earliest forms of storytelling and entertainment.  However, in the age of streaming video on demand, and massively multiplayer online games, can this venerable art form still be considered relevant, when even our movie multiplexes are going by the wayside?  Recent Broadway musicals such as Hamilton have certainly made a powerful case for the theater's continued relevancy, simultaneously breaking box office records and offering innovative approaches to content and form while appealing to younger and non-traditional theater audiences.  
In this seminar we will consider a number of major plays and musicals produced on and off Broadway since the year 2000. Among the questions to be considered over the course of the semester: What does it mean to create and experience theater in the context of emerging technologies?  Has theater continued to evolve to address the changing needs and sensibilities of 21st century audiences?  In what ways does it provide a voice to marginalized social groups?
In addition to readings and class discussions, students will also be required to attend live performances (both professional and academic) and compose essays offering informed critiques evaluating particular aspects of the theatrical whole.

USSY,292N,"Cli-Fi: Addressing Climate Change in Fact, Fiction, and Film",3,"This seminar examines the emerging literary genre of Cli-Fi, or climate fiction, which bridges genres such as science fiction and apocalyptic literature as it depicts imagined responses to the damage wrought by global climate change. In the early 1960s, well in advance of compelling scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change, novelists were already speculating about the effects of global warming. Focusing on fiction, films, and non-fiction writing from the past three decades, we will consider how authors envision the effects of climate change. Specifically, we will read works by historians, journalists, philosophers, scientists, and cultural critics as a foundation for our analysis of several works of fiction. Further, we will consider how visual media, like feature and documentary films, depict the impacts of climate change. Centrally, we will evaluate how climate fiction complements existing popular and academic conversations about our transforming world. Ultimately, responding to the broadening field of narratives about human-generated transformations of the world, we will address climate fiction's potential to influence ethical paths shaped by those who seek to alter the disastrous trajectory that the genre imagines.

Over the course of the semester, we'll be studying the changing forms Hamlet has taken. We'll think first about the inspirations for Shakespeare's play in Danish sagas and Roman tragedy, and subsequently read Hamlet alongside a variety of reinterpretations and revisions in different media (from short stories, to films, to videogames) spanning 400 years and hailing from across the globe.
We will learn about the cultural, social and political contexts that shape how adaptations are produced and received. We'll also think critically about the elements that constitute a particular work of art in a particular medium, and about the processes through which new works can be made out of old ones.

USSY,292Q,The Secret Lives of Animals,3,"Animals are instructive. When we study animals, their biological makeups and creaturely habits, we do so with hopes of learning something about them. At the same time, such investigations often betray an interest in our human selves. The study of animals, in scientific and literary laboratories alike, quickly turns to acts of self-discovery: not what it means to be animal, exactly, but what it means to be human-animals. So what more could we learn by cultivating new strategies for listening and new languages for communicating with animals?

This seminar invites students to investigate the secret lives of animals as imagined in a sampling of classical, medieval and modern literatures. Thinking with animals past and present--in fables, manuals, and tales--we will examine human-animal relationships in imagined settings. Over the course of the semester, we will read, view, listen, and perform works in which animals are tasked with teaching moral lessons and testing the ethical obligations of their human audiences. Comparing treatments of companion animals past and present, we will reflect on the many ways literature can guide our evolving relationship to the animal kingdom.

USSY,292S,The Meaning of Life: A Novel Idea,3,"According to the critic Walter Benjamin, while short stories can convey a moral, ""The 'meaning of life' is really the center about which the novel moves."" Many critics share this view, arguing that the very idea of ""the meaning of life"" emerges alongside of the novel genre because of the ways novels portray individuals thinking about their lives. Novels characters internally reflect, make choices, and interact with others--often over long periods of time and through many changing circumstances. Furthermore, they depict how characters--personal choices--are influenced by a variety of external, social forces. In doing so, novels have offered their readers ways to think about what they value, and why. 

This seminar will take up the novel genre as a way to think carefully and deeply about just what the idea of ""the meaning of life"" involves. We will discuss how various novels have addressed--and continue to address--the desire for fulfillment and purpose. We will begin by examining how it came to be that novels came to be associated with and helped create the very concept of the ""meaning of life."" Then we read some classic novels to examine how the novel has portrayed the meaning of life. We will conclude the course with a contemporary novel and ask whether or not contemporary novels are creating experiences of meaning in the same way they did hundreds of years ago. If they are, is that meaning still the same? If not, are novels asking different kinds of big questions? Is ""the meaning of life"" not as vital as it used to be to how novels work? In addressing these questions we will strive to understand the history of this literary form, its uses for our own personal introspection and ethical thinking, as well as the continuing role of novels in our rapidly evolving society.

What responsibilities does a state have, if it is to maintain its authority? Under what conditions can a state lose its legitimacy? When do individuals have a moral responsibility to resist state power? What forms can such resistance take and still be considered moral? In undertaking these questions, we will read a wide range of texts from different disciplines, periods of history, parts of the world, and cultural and religious backgrounds.  The final project will require you to articulate a careful and morally consistent `insurgency in which (i) the form of resistance is appropriate to the nature and degree of the state's failures, and (ii) the moral justification for the `insurgency does not violate the moral reasoning that justified resistance in the first place.

For survivors of the worst atrocities in recent history, remembering is seen as both a moral and political duty. But how should the memory of these mass traumas be carried forward in the public sphere? And what forms of commemoration are the most effective, accurate, or enduring? In this course, we will examine the remembering of trauma in a range of public ""memory sites,"" including oral testimonies, published memoirs, monuments, museums, and films. We will also consider postmodern forms of ""counter-memory"" in contemporary photography and conceptual art. While we will discuss a range of ""memory sites,"" we will focus primarily on those that reflect on the Holocaust and 9/11. We will examine how and why different memorial practices have evolved, and reflect on the value of passing on such horrific memories to future generations. We'll also discuss how the process of remembering alters the meaning of traumatic events. As a culminating project, students will analyze a memorial site or institution, using existing scholarship to investigate the creation of the site, its sources of funding, its design process, and the controversies it created.

USSY,293I,High Art and Guilty Pleasures,3,"How, and why, do we draw distinctions between art and entertainment? Lowbrow and highbrow? A crowd-pleasing ""flick"" and a critic-approved ""film?"" This seminar will explore the logic of this common sorting process, as well as its consequences. After all, such distinctions historically have been linked with other forms of discrimination--often amplifying or silencing certain voices on the basis of gender, race, or class. In this course we'll investigate these connections between critical evaluation and broader social dynamics, while also engaging critically with our own tastes, values, and received ideas. What makes The Great Gatsby so great? Is there any value in keeping up with the Kardashians? Who determines the criteria that make one work a ""classic,"" the other a ""guilty pleasure?"" Traversing a range of artworks, novels, comics, and movies, we'll work both the high and the low ends of the cultural spectrum, paying special attention to works that seem to blur or combine the usual categories--compelling us to ask whether great art and guilty pleasures can sometimes be one and the same.

USSY,293N,Global Shakespeares,3,"The British playwright Ben Jonson famously eulogized his friend and competitor William Shakespeare by saying, ""...he was not of an age but for all time."" Recently, however, scholars and theater practitioners have been far more engaged with the question of whether Shakespeare is for all nations. In this course, we will consider what it means to read Shakespeare globally. Shakespeare wrote his plays during the first era of British colonial expansion; today, we read those same plays during a supposedly ""post-colonial"" era. Accordingly, we will ask two related but possibly opposing questions: What did Shakespeare think of the world?  and What does the world think about Shakespeare? In order to answer these questions, we will read three plays in which Shakespeare directly engages issues of cultural difference and empire alongside contemporary adaptations of those plays from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. How aware was Shakespeare of the specific cultural identities of the Mediterranean or the ""New World?"" Conversely, is a work ""still"" Shakespeare when it has been translated into a different cultural setting? In addition to gaining a finer understanding of Shakespeare's work and its historical context, we will examine how and why Shakespeare's drama can be repurposed in different political and national contexts today.

USSY,293O,Monsters and Disability,3,"Why are monsters everywhere in literature, film, and art? How does disability, mental illness, and medicine find their way into cultural fantasies and anxieties? Who or what are the monsters of our own cultural moment? In what ways do monsters represent and reinforce prejudices related to mental illness, disability, race, gender, religion, or nationality? What are the ethical conflicts and demands made by the monster? In this seminar, we will explore the history, art, and ethics of monsters in western culture. Using selections from disability studies, trauma theory, gender studies, critical race studies, and post-colonial studies, we will examine monsters not merely as super-natural creatures, but as figures that stand in for a wide range of ""undesirables"" and ""others."" Readings and films for this class will be drawn from the distant medieval past up to modern horror and fantasy films, and will feature the monsters said to live on the edge of the known world, mystical visionaries, sideshow freaks, hallucinatory apparitions, witches, and even a few vampires and werewolves.

USSY,293P,Music in Time and Place: A Window into the Development of American Identity,3,"Although American symphonic music grew out of the Western European tradition, it also developed distinct characteristics. Composers marveled at the qualities and character of the young nation, especially the vastness and beauty of its land. An aesthetic sense of the land influenced artists as they sought to capture their perspectives of time and space, as well as the American people themselves, and the role they played in those perspectives. In this course, we will examine a series of symphonic works that specifically reference geographical place in their titles. Through this study we will gain insight into the development of American cultural identity and how the focus of musical works shifted from rural to urban life. To enhance our understanding, we will consider the historical context of these American symphonic works, as well as related works of art.

SJUS,100,Introduction to Social Justice,3,"Quests for justice and struggles against injustice have shaped human understanding, behavior and relationships for centuries. Individuals operate within community contexts created through interactions and relationships structured by sociability, belonging, and responsibility. Probing broad questions, this signature core course will encourage students to think critically and expansively about the social world and the conditions of humanity. The course will provide a foundational exploration of social justice concepts, issues, and remedies, thereby developing the necessary analytical tools and information to assess inequality and injustice and address historical and contemporary issues. Following an interdisciplinary, case-study approach, featuring faculty from different schools and departments at CWRU, this course also will provide students with multiple frameworks for understanding the interconnections between what are often perceived as disparate and disconnected fields of study and inquiry. Three primary questions guide the course: What is social justice? Why does social justice matter? What can be done? Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."
USSO,201,Society and Technology: How Do They Impact One Another?,3,"This course focuses on a systematic analysis of the relationships between society, and the specific institutional elements of technology and technological innovation. It describes the social aspects of computers and related technologies and explores the ways in which these technologies influence and impact organizations and individuals. The course explores the design, use and cultural significance of technologies and uses a historical focus to assess the integration of technology into all aspects of our society. The restructuring of traditional human interaction by information technology will provide a contemporary focus for the course. Offered in a seminar format, the course will provide opportunities for scholarly discussion, systematic inquiry and written communication.

USSO,209,Face First,3,"Human beings greet the world face first. In fact, the ability to process facial features seems to be innate. A baby easily recognizes its mother's face yet the most powerful computers have difficulty using facial features to identify people. This is because all human faces are similar while fine details make each face unique. This course will begin by studying the human face as an anatomic construction of hard and soft tissue skeletal components. We will discuss how we use anatomic facial features to recognize individuals. One homework exercise will be to construct faces using an FBI identikit. Each student will create an FBI composite sketch of their own face. Seminar time will then be used to view each sketch and try to match the sketch with the seminar participant. Discussion will focus on how facial anatomy is similar or different. Following this introduction, the seminar will shift focus from anatomy to sociology. We will discuss facial attractiveness and beauty. Seminar topics will also include manipulation of facial appearance i.e., cosmetics, body piercing, veils, and plastic surgery.

USSO,234,Questions of Identity,3,"Who we are informs the ways in which we act in the world.  How we respond to society in the individual, local, and global community is impacted by the way we see ourselves, the way others see us, and the way we see others.  Who am I?  How do I look at myself in relationship to others?  How does the way in which society views me affect the way I think of myself?  How have writers, historians, and philosophers dealt with the challenges of self and group identity?  We will explore these issues through readings from the Civil Rights Era, the Holocaust, and the period of decolonization in Africa.

USSO,243,The Art of Fact,3,"As evidenced by the tragedy that unfolded in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we ignore the consequences of endemic poverty at our peril.  How do you evacuate a city filled with thousands of people too poor to own cars?  Where do you house them after they've been rescued from their drowned neighborhoods?  Although Cleveland won't likely be erased by flood, it's one of the poorest big cities in the nation making it vulnerable to disaster in times of crisis and an incubator for a host of thorny social problems.  Often, it's up to journalists to bring attention to these issues, give voice to the voiceless and force policymakers to come up with solutions to seemingly intractable problems.  In this seminar, we'll read and dissect the works of journalists who've written stories about complex social problems and have done so using many of the conventions employed by writers of fiction.  Writer Ben Yagoda described this literary journalism as ""making facts dance.""  We'll spend our time researching numerous social issues and learn to write about them in a clear and compelling voice.

We will cover such issues as race/class/gender and the law, legal ethics, legal education, the adversarial system, and the image and status of the lawyer in American culture. We will also look at the ways in which law and the legal profession affect popular culture and, conversely, the ways in which poplar views of legal problems and lawyers affect law.

USSO,271,Schoolhouse Rocked: Education Reform,3,"Today, the term ""education reform"" may bring to mind standardized tests and No Child Left Behind. Many believe that our schools must become more rigorous, with stricter rules and definable goals. ""Reform,"" however, used to be defined differently. John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and Paulo-Freire, for example, struggled to make schools freer and more humane. They hoped not to make the classroom less challenging, but more child-centered. Some disciples of such reformers, discouraged by schools' resistance to change, eventually turned to homeschooling--pulling kids out of school and educating them with real-life learning experiences. In this seminar, we will explore progressive educational theory and connect it with contemporary alternative schools and homeschooling. Visits to nearby Montessori and Waldorf schools and discussions with homeschoolers will make real-life connections to seminar reading and classwork. Challenging assumptions about how well our schools work and raising questions such as, ""How do we learn?"" and ""What is good teaching?"" will provoke thought, conversation, and interesting writing.

What are the most important qualities, emotional and cognitive, that are related to creativity?  Is there a creative personality?  What is the difference between artistic and scientific creativity?  How does creativity relate to mental illness?  How can we foster creativity in people? The course will study creativity in children and adults and will include research studies as well as descriptions of creativity from creative individuals.  We will also discuss how different cultures view and effect creativity and the ethical issues involved.  This course is a seminar and will use a discussion format.

USSO,285D,Advertising and the American Dream,3,"This SAGES seminar will explore advertising in America, its social and cultural roots, and its impact (or lack thereof) on our values, tastes, and behavior as consumers and citizens.  It is hard to find a space in the contemporary world that is not plastered with ads--from the Coke cups next to the judges on ""American Idol"" to stencils on the sidewalks we walk on.  This blizzard of advertising images may, in fact, define our age.  We will examine the forces that created this giant American industry and ask: Why do we have advertising? How is it created?  What social functions does it serve? How has it changed?  Where is it going?  Central to this seminar is discussion, research, and writing to analyze and critique this in-our-face, but little understood, social institution.  Some of our discussions will flow from advertising industry news (e.g., the Super Bowl ads), a contemporary or early 20th century ad campaign, or the backstage insights of a guest from one of Cleveland's major ad agencies.

USSO,285I,Spectacle in American Culture,3,"This seminar will examine the topic of spectacle both chronologically and typologically to better u understand the power of remarkable visual experiences to awe, entertain, persuade, and create meaning from the colonial period to the present day.  In the 17th century, the religious beliefs of the New England community and its need to maintain social cohesiveness gave rise to the spectacle of witch trials and public punishments. As Americans moved westward, the natural world became the focus of the spectacular.  In the nineteenth century, the campaigns and debates of presidential candidates became political theater.  The latter half of the century gave rise to Consumption as Spectacle as exemplified in the may expositions and World's Fairs.  Today, spectacle has reached all facets of our lives.  Americans are willing to expose the most intimate details of their personal relationships on television shows like Jerry Springer and The Real World.  Although frequently used to maintain power, spectacle also has been employed as a tactic of resistance and as an instrument for creating alternative meaning by subcultures. More recently, spectacle has served as an instrument of terror. Through lectures, discussion, multimedia presentations, and writing assignments, we will have an opportunity to reflect on the many forms and uses of spectacle in American history.

USSO,285J,The Limits of Science,3,"Can science provide answers to the deeper puzzles of human existence, or do some questions lie beyond the scope of the scientific world view? Specifically, can science explain human consciousness, free will, and morality; and can it reveal the origins of religion? Students cannot, nor will they be expected to, provide a definitive answer to these questions. Instead, this seminar will provide students with an opportunity to engage in a conversation with each other against a backdrop of some of the most interesting and provocative research in cognitive science. In addition to learning about relevant psychological and neuroscientific research, students will engage with philosophical issues and arguments. This course aims to stretch student's beliefs about what they know now, and what they think can be known. The seminar will aim to cultivate productive and rhetorical skills, especially analytical thought, oral expressiveness, and writing skills, all of which will be useful in future pursuits. It will help students to develop a more nuanced view of human nature and the ability of science to transform our view of it.

USSO,285K,The Economics of Global Poverty,3,"Developing countries make up at least three-fourths of the world population.  This course focuses on international aspects of economics of the developing world.  Questions we will ask include: why are the poorest countries failing to thrive, what can be done about it, and can the rich afford to help the poor?  The term ""developing country"" means a country that exhibits low per capita income, high poverty level, little industrialization, or low life expectancy.  However, these problems also affect developed countries.  Why, then, do we study poor countries' economies separately from those of industrialized nations?  The answer lies not in the types of problems but in the severity and causes of these problems.  It is these issues, the causes and consequences of global poverty, and solutions to help the world's poorest, that concern us here.  Raising people out of poverty requires economic growth, a more even income distribution, investment in education, health care, and infrastructure, social safety nets, honest political leaders, reliable social and financial institutions, and international aid from rich countries.

In addition to the general history of the field and key periods of creative development in the genre, we will discuss various sub-genres or narrative fads within animation, cultural and social movements of the 20th century and how they are reflected in contemporaneous popular culture, issues of art versus commerce in the creation of popular animation, the intersection of animation and politics, and the representation of race, gender, sexuality and religion. Since this class focuses on visual media, we will also spend a great deal of time both watching films and discussing how to watch animated films with a critical eye.

How do cults manage to attract and maintain large memberships?  How can so many seemingly normal people come to the conclusion that they have been abducted by aliens?  We will explore the idea that these behaviors are not examples of pathological thought processes, but rather natural consequences of the biases that characterize everyday reasoning.  Emphasis will be placed on critical examination of questionable phenomena with a goal of understanding why people might want to hold such beliefs.

USSO,285V,Travel Literature in the Age of Discovery,3,"The discovery of the Americas in the 15th century challenged European constructions of the known world and tested assumptions about nature, culture, and the workings of intellectual inquiry. Although before 1492 Europeans traveled, they usually read new landscapes in light of familiar religious paradigms. The discoveries forced Europeans to draw the world anew, literally and metaphorically. Students will read works of travel fiction and real-life travelers' tales, and will address the following questions: how did travel literature reflect successive discoveries? What new maps (geographical or metaphorical) did this literature help draw? How did the discoveries bear on literary genres? After a brief foray into medieval literature, students will read The Tempest, Oroonoko, excerpts from The Persian Letters, excerpts from Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe, Candide, and A Sentimental Journey. Additionally, students will read brief accounts of actual travels. Students will write three papers and prepare presentations on topics such as pilgrimage routes, map making, the search for longitude, and America in the visual arts.

Increasingly, we rely on courts and statutes to ""fix"" identified social problems and to achieve a more just society.  This course will examine our reliance on law to improve human behavior and to achieve social goals.  Can statutes and lawyers lead the way to a better world?  What are the limits (if any) of our ability to improve society by passing new laws and mandates?  Are there unforeseen, negative consequences that arise from our legal efforts to improve public and personal behavior?  This course will examine those questions in the context of selected social issues.

USSO,286E,Global Tourism,3,"Tourism can be viewed as a metaphor for contemporary existence in an increasingly globalizing world where attachments and ties to a concrete place are often temporary.  Besides capturing the essence of present-day mobility, tourism is a phenomenon that can be researched both politically and economically.  Indeed, 10 percent of global GNP comes from tourism and many poor countries rely on the tourism industry to sustain national economic development.  In this class, we will touch on the economic and political significance of tourism, but will spend most of our time thinking of what happens in the tourist encounter, what tourists expect, what drives them, and who loses as well as benefits in the encounter.  Some of the specific themes include: the nature of tourist destinations, quest for authentic sites, entertainment tourism (Disneyland, Dracula-Park), tourism to Auschwitz, culinary tourism, sex tourism, and eco-tourism.  By reading theoretical works, travel blogs, and literature, we will gain insight to the motivations of tourists, the inhabitants of the places being visited, and international organizations as well as governments who oversee this industry.

Developing nations typically sacrifice environmental protection in favor of economic development.  Only when the costs of environmental degradation become obvious do nations consider a sustainable development regime that includes environmental protection.  This seminar addresses whether implementing a sustainable development model requires a new civic culture that encourages political reform.  In doing so, students will examine and write about literature on economic development, environmental degradation, and several international initiatives that encourage reforms to aid sustainable development.  The seminar will use the People's Republic of China as a case study, but will also draw on evidence from other developing countries.

USSO,286M,Hip-Hop Narrative in Film,3,"This seminar explores films of the Hip-Hop Generation and, by presenting certain films in chronological order, draws out the common threads.  Hip-Hop culture is a conversation, an argument between the have-nots and the rest of us.  The goals and objectives of that conversation have evolved and changed in timbre and urgency.  Tracking that dialog through the late 60s, the post-civil rights era, the emergence of the b-boy, Reaganomics, and the rise of the new Black middle class helps us to get a better look at where it is and where it's going.  By isolating the stories told by filmmakers within a certain period and then analyzing their place in the larger Hip-Hop narrative, the instructor and the students can infer truths about the politics and zeitgeist of the times in which the film works were conceived.  This course will consist of lots of film, yes, but also lots of reading and writing.  Upon successful completion, the student should be able to recognize and define the Hip-Hop narrative in popular cinema, focus critical thinking skills, pull the narrative from certain films and discuss it, note and discuss the visual aesthetic and how it impacts the story, and discuss the marketing, packaging, and cultural impact of the Hip-Hop narrative.

USSO,286X,The Future of News,3,"The saying goes, ""Strong Press, Strong Democracy.""  But what of strong democracy in the Internet Age when the traditional press seems weak?  That's this seminar's big question.  Can the ""old"" media, struggling to avoid financial collapse, still deliver the news necessary to be democracy's watchdog, as in the past?  Can the new internet media--blogs, YouTube, viral videos, ""hyperlocalism"" experiments, pro publica investigations, crowd sourcing, instant news, Facebook, Gawker, True/Slant, Drudge and the proliferation of the other news and entertainment sources--take its place or complement traditional journalism?  How do these new entrants change the nature of news and the role of the media in our society?  These are uncharted developments, but they go to the heart of the continued success of America's democratic experiment.  Our goal is to grasp more clearly the connections between media, news, citizenship and democracy in this new age.

USSO,287C,Murder in the Jazz Age,3,"Having lived through the devastation and consequences of World War I, you might think that Americans would have been appalled by the violent murders that marred the 1920s.  To be sure, they were. Americans were also drawn to the infamous murders as though understanding these crimes would enable them to explain the changes in society, such as changes to gender rules and urbanization, brought about and accelerated by the war.  In this class, we will examine the major crimes of the decade in the hopes of gaining the insight that the people at the time sought.

The course readings include secondary sources that provide an analysis of the decade and primary sources from the murder cases themselves.  In addition, students will become familiar with the historical context and scientific advancements that gave birth to modern forensics.

USSO,287E,"Clash of the Titans: Economic, Industrial and Social Trends for the 21st Century",3,"Since the beginning of recorded human civilization, locally dominant societies have risen, prospered, decayed and finally ended, with new ones taking their place.  Starting in the 15th century, however, Europe established global dominance and maintained it for four centuries, from the age of New World exploration through the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.  Then came the rise of the United States, which in the late 20th century became the world's only superpower, economically, industrially, militarily and, increasingly, culturally.  

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, we are witnessing the ""flattening"" of the world due to the technological revolution, a phenomenon brought about by the instant and worldwide generation of and access to information.  Two major consequences of this evolution are: a) Individuals are more empowered than at any time in history and the traditional societal structure is under constant challenge; b) Companies have changed their business structures and practices and have begun to operate on a truly global scale.

The main goal of the course is to help students learn the lessons of history and use them to develop an educated argument as to whether the US will continue in its prominent leadership role, or whether one or both of the emerging Asian economic powerhouses, China and India, will supplant it and become dominant.

USSO,287H,Vocation and Life,3,"What is your life for?  Should it be for anything?  The idea of a vocation originally meant a calling to a higher purpose, however that may be conceived.  Over time, the idea of a vocation flattened out and became another word for a job.  Yet living for a job hardly seems like living.  One advantage of the older meaning of the word was to highlight this fact:  the question of life is how to live life.  In this course, we explore the concept of a vocation--both as a calling and as a job--and we use the seminar format and its exercises to provide ourselves with the opportunity to focus our lives on what we are living for, or, at the least, why we do not think we need to do anything beyond just living well.  But what is it to live well?  What is the point of all our work?

This seminar will explore five elements of the business model that is driving this growth: content, television, social media, advertising, and consumer products.  In addition, it will examine the marketing of these five elements.

Students will be graded on class participation, essays, and a final paper.  They will be asked to read weekly articles on each aspect of the sports industry and to participate in social media sites in order to understand how powerful this platform is to the sports business.  In addition, they will work together in groups to create their own sports marketing websites and present these sites for evaluation by the entire class.  The results of the evaluation will contribute to their grade for this part of the course.

Guest lecturers for the seminar will include nationally recognized experts and representatives of the sports industry, many of whom visit northeast Ohio for sporting events.  Students in the course will acquire a unique perspective on a business that is projected to become one of the world's leading growth industries in the 21st century.

The impact of the courtesan on society can be seen in travelogues, poetry, and historical treatises, as well as in texts written specifically about courtesans themselves.  Those cultures which had a courtesan class frequently experienced varying degrees of social discomfort.  Within the culture, there was tension between those who patronized courtesans and those who considered them a social menace.  From without, cultures which had courtesans were believed to be either excessively decadent or highly civilized, depending on the cultural standpoint of the observer.  
In this seminar, we will study real courtesans as well as examine the figure of the courtesan within the context of literature, religion, music history, and gender theory.  The seminar will begin with an overview of the origins of the courtesan, focused on the roles of women and slave musicians in the court and temple in Egypt, India, Greece, and Mesopotamia starting in 3,000 BCE.  Then, we will explore factors leading to the development of a courtesan class and compare the roles of courtesans and their place in their culture in Europe, India, Asia, and the Middle East.  Readings and class discussion will encompass issues relating to the impact of gender on performance, literary genres, education, and social and legal status, as well as continuing questions related to translation of primary sources, colonialism, and religious movements.  In addition to the readings, we will also study images of the courtesan from antiquity to the present, listen to music by and about courtesans, sample some of their writing, and watch films about ""real"" courtesans.  The primary goal is not only to look at the impact of courtesans in history, but also to engage issues related to gender and performance from a variety of different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

USSO,287V,The Public and the Past: History in the Marketplace,3,"How does one or should one ""sell"" the past? Our primary encounters with the past are not in the university classroom, but via popular media, museums, theme parks, and historic sites; entities whose survival is increasingly dependent upon market economics. This dependency often demands attention to audience size and the need to avoid controversies that could alienate private and public funders. Complicating this is the issue of heritage--the somewhat mythic pasts which individuals, groups, and nations claim as their right, even when research challenges the underlying myths. What then are the consequences, in terms of ethics and accuracy, or in terms of civic value, when one turns history into a heritage-based commodity? More specifically, how does this affect professional historians? Can they work in history outside of academe without sacrificing integrity and standards? The seminar will debate these critical questions and also take an in-depth look at the growing field (positions, products and potential) of public/applied history. Readings, documentaries, interviews, and on-site visits to public history institutions will provide the basis for our discussions and the written assignments in this seminar as well as serve as an introductory ""course"" for students interested in a career in public or applied history.

USSO,287X,The War,,"Why do people go to war? Why are they willing to give up everything and send their children off to fight? What makes people cheer when war is declared? This class will address these questions by focusing on 1914 and the start of the First World War. It will be a course focused on understanding the politics, motivations, and imaginings surrounding the origins of World War I.

USSO,287Z,"Concubines, Soldiers and Field Hands: World Slavery from Antiquity to the Present",3,"For many Americans, the most familiar type of slavery is plantation slavery of the Americas and the horrific consequences to the indigenous peoples and transplanted peoples from Africa. The longevity of the institution of slavery, and acceptance of the practice by many different cultures and belief systems, however, reaches from antiquity to the present day. In addition to providing physical labor and domestic services, slaves have been used as entertainers, civil servants, led armies and served in temples. Slavery is a complex legal, religious, moral and social institution, and the relationship between slave, state and owner/slaver is equally complicated; so much so that understanding the bond between them, and what the actual boundary was between ""free"" and ""un-free"", is still difficult to determine in some cultures.
In this seminar, we will use a chronological framework to examine the institution of slavery, uses for slaves, methodologies and sources for studying slavery and the slave trade in world history. Beginning with slavery in the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece and Rome, the class will include slavery and the feudal system in medieval Europe, indentured servitude and concubinage, slaves in the early Islamic courts, the Ottoman slave trade, the African slave trade and slavery in the Americas, and the current problem of human trafficking. Within each section, students will read primary texts and recent scholarship examining the social, economic and religious rationales behind slavery. We will also study different methodologies and the impact of gender, race and social class on the study of world slavery. As many slaver cultures had different definitions for what it meant to be a slave, we will address questions related to translation, interpretation and perception when dealing with primary sources. The primary goal of the course is to provide a broader context for the institution of slavery in world history as a means not only to understand the impact of slavery has had on American culture, but on other cultures as well.

USSO,288B,Doing Good: How Nonprofits Change Lives,3,"The American economy is made up of three sectors: government, business, and nonprofit. It's pretty obvious what government and business do, but the activity of nonprofits, while it is everywhere, is much more subtle. A nonprofit is most likely where you were born, went to school, attend church, or adopted your family dog. If you became an Eagle Scout, watched ""Sesame Street,"" attended a benefit concert, or participated in a walk for a cause, you were engaged with a nonprofit. Perhaps you haven't given much thought to the way the organization was structured, where it gets its money, or what kind of an impact it's really having. In this seminar, students will learn what nonprofits are, how they operate, how they influence everyday lives, and their role in advancing social change and a civil society. We will consider the economic impact of nonprofits as well as their role in protecting culture, environment, values, and heritage. We will also look at the key challenges facing nonprofits today and how they are addressing them. Writing assignments will include a grant proposal for a new or existing nonprofit. The seminar will feature guest speakers and class visits to nonprofits in the Cleveland area.

SYBB,421,Fundamentals of Clinical Information Systems,3,"Technology has played a significant role in the evolution of medical science and treatment.  While we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  Information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  This introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (CIS).  Often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the ""art"" of CIS more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  In this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (A) operational and strategic information needs, (B) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (C) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.  Legal and ethical issues are explored.  The student learns the process of ""plan, design, implement"" through hands-on applications to select CIS problems, while at the same time gaining insights and understanding of the impacts placed on patients and health care providers.

SOCI,275,Lives in Medicine: Becoming and Being a Physician,3,"This course applies a sociological approach to medical profession.  Medical sociology emerged as a distinct field of study in the 1950s in part due to prominent studies of medical education such as The Student Physician by Robert K. Merton and Howard Becker's Boys in White.  Since then, sociologists and other social scientists have written extensively about how issues of race, gender, aging and ethnicity are tied to issues of medical education, medical training, medical socialization and physician decision-making.  Using a life course perspective, this course will examine how lives in medicine change over time; in particular, we'll study changing workforce patterns, physician satisfaction, and burnout.  Other topics to be covered include contemporary ethical issues and alternative professional health careers.

RLGN,227,"Women, Gender, and Islam",3,"Women and gender are central to understanding Muslim societies, past and present. From debates about the veil to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, gendered concerns have been especially prominent in contemporary debates about the status of Islam in the modern world. How have Muslim thinkers interpreted Islamic scriptures with respect to topics such as marriage, child custody, inheritance, and sexuality? How is masculinity and femininity constructed? In what ways do their interpretations reflect the political, economic, and social conditions in which they lived? How does gender structure authority and power in Muslim communities? How and why have Muslim women become so important in contemporary debates over religious and national identity around the world? 

This course begins by examining the position of women and gender in the foundational Islamic texts, the Qur'an and Sunna (the practice of the Prophet Muhammad), and pre-modern interpretations of them.  Then we will explore marriage and divorce in Muslim jurisprudence, in order to examine themes such as women's spiritual capacities, female leadership, sexuality, and slavery. Next, we will turn to the headscarf as a lens though which to explore modern configurations of gender and sexuality, as they intersect with conceptions of national belonging, religious identity, and individual freedom.

The primarily aim of this course is to introduce an image of Jesus little known outside the Arabic Islamic culture. It is an image that might be of interest to those who wish to understand how Jesus was perceived by a religious tradition which greatly revered him but rejected his divinity. Hence, the Jesus presented in this course will be similar in some ways to the Jesus in the Christian Gospels, in others not. Why and how this Muslim tradition of Jesus arose will be also discussed in this course.  Jesus Through Islamic Lens will draw from various Islamic texts to provide a comprehensive selection of excerpts pertaining to the life and moral teachings of Jesus. Approaching Christ from an Islamic perspective, this course will offer the students a rare opportunity to understand the significance of Jesus in Islam  and to gain a better understanding of the faith, not only as it contrasts with Christianity but also as it compares. 

In this course we will try to respond to these questions: What role does Jesus have in Islam?  What does the Quran say about Him? What does it not say?  Why are Muslims repulsed by the idea that Jesus is the Son of God, fully God and fully man?  What do Muslims have in mind when they acknowledge Jesus as virgin-born? 
 
This course also requires reading literature that pertains to the history of Islam, its theology and its culture, and because of its emphasis on an area of the world historically distinct from the West (or European culture), the course will fulfill the Global and Cultural Diversity requirement.

Major concerns of the course include the political meanings and import of ""sex,"" ""gender,"" and ""politics;"" the relationship between women and the state; how women organize collectively to influence state policies; and how the state facilitates and constrains women's access to and exercise of political power.

China today faces new circumstances that have caused deep and broad challenges to its people.

POSC,370H,China's Foreign Policy,3,"The rise of China is evident in the country's more forward and robust foreign policy that began in 1979.  At every turn, nations throughout the world must now consider China wherever their interests are at stake, be it Korea and Northeast Asia, Indochina and Southeast Asia, India/Pakistan and South Asia, or Afghanistan and Iran in the Middle East, not to mention the many African states that welcome Chinese investment but chafe at China's presence.

POSC,375,The International Politics of Technology,3,"Technology is deeply political.  Nowhere is this statement more evident than in the realm of international relations, where governments perceive technology as a source of power and wealth and a symbol of relative position and modernity.  Yet for centuries skeptics have questioned the economic rationale of government technology policies.  Still, to this day, countries support emulation, innovation and a host of other strategies as means for catching up with leading nations or locking in current advantages.  What lies behind such policies?  What do they accomplish?  And what are the domestic and international politics surrounding them? After reading classic arguments, including texts by Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List, students will consider 20th and 21st century debates and an array of experiments tried by poor, middle-income and rich countries.

The countries that comprise the modern Middle East are quite diverse; therefore, we will only be able to focus on a few cases in depth.  A second goal is to use the tools and theories social scientists employ to answer broad questions related to the region, such as: How have colonial legacies shaped political and economic development in the Middle East?

POSC,380A,State and War in Africa and the Middle East,3,"The Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa remain the most volatile and conflict prone regions of the world.  Traditional approaches to war and state conflict have emphasized systemic variables, such as balance of power, military capabilities, perceptions, the security dilemma, and of course anarchy.  While these concepts have generated much academic interest, their ability to explain and understand conflict in the developing world is severely limited.  This is due to the basic fact that nearly all conflict in the world today is not between states but is taking place within state boundaries.  What drives these conflicts?  Are there common factors and patterns within the Middle East and Africa?  How does sub-state conflict affect political and economic development?  What are the most likely resolution strategies?  Recommended preparation:"

POSC,385,Doing Government Work: Public Administration in the U,S,"This course focuses on how governments, particularly governments in the United States, do their work.  The topic is often called ""public administration,"" or ""implementation,"" or ""bureaucratic politics.""  It involves what James Q. Wilson calls government ""operators"" such as teachers, public health doctors, agricultural extension agents, grant administrators and Seal teams.  Their actions depend on their own values; conflict among political authorities, and on what is needed to perform specific tasks.  We will begin by discussing the challenges of organizing to do anything, or organization theory; turn to the peculiar political context of administration in the United States; and apply these understandings to specific government activities.  Students should emerge with a better understanding of why government agencies do what they do, and why they succeed or fail.
Offered as"
POSC,386,Making Public Policy,3,"Politics is about who wins, who loses, and why.  Policy, by contrast, is often depicted as more ""neutral;"" policies are the means through which political decisions are carried out.  In this class, we examine the notion that policy is the rational, impartial counterpart to the political arena.  We will ask: How are public policies made?  Why do some issues make it on to the agenda, while others do not?  Can we separate facts from values, or are both always contested?  We will examine how decision-making in a group introduces distinct challenges for policymaking.  The course focuses on widely applicable themes of policymaking, drawing on both domestic and international examples.

Using concepts from political science and economics, we investigate the challenges in getting states to act jointly to address environmental problems.  We examine the actors and institutions of global environmental politics, to understand how conditions are defined as problems and responses are chosen and implemented.  The course concludes by applying the tools and concepts to the case of climate change.

Finally, we will discuss the policy-making process.  In that context, we will address the role that interest groups play in the process, and how the quest for economic benefits for one's constituency motivates the behavior of elected officials.  We will conclude by discussing how policy changes at the systematic level occur and the influence that various groups have on policy outcomes.

The course begins with an examination of three general bodies of theory and research on political movements: resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, and cultural framing.  We will also investigate frameworks of political participation for understanding the relationships among different expressions of collective activism and representation.  In the context of these sometimes competing theories, we will consider 1) the conditions under which political movements are likely to emerge, as well as the circumstances in which collective political action is precluded; 2) how citizens come to recognize collective grievances and shared political identities; 3) the strategies and tactics of organized movements, and their likelihood of political success; and 4) the relationship between political movements, political parties, and the state.

POSC,446,"Women, Power, and Politics",3,"Women, Power, and Politics involves a critical examination of the impact of gender on the forms and distributions of power and politics, with primary reference to the experience of women in the United States.  Major concerns of the course include the political meanings and import of ""sex,"" ""gender,"" and ""politics;"" the relationship between women and the state; how women organize collectively to influence state policies; and how the state facilitates and constrains women's access to and exercise of political power.  The course is organized around four foci central to the study of women and politics.  The first section of the course focuses on the meanings of ""women,"" ""gender,"" and ""politics.""  In this section, we will consider how these concepts intersect and the ways in which each may be used to deepen our understanding of the workings of governments and political systems, and of women's relative political powerlessness.  The second section of the course employs these concepts to understand the (re) emergence of the US feminist movement, its meanings, practices, and goals, and its transformation across US political history.  In the third section, we turn to conventional electoral politics, focusing on women's candidacies, their campaigns, and women's voting behavior.  In the final section of the course, we consider those general factors that might provide for increased gender equality and improved life status for women, in global, comparative perspective.

POSC,475,The International Politics of Technology,3,"Technology is deeply political.  Nowhere is this statement more evident than in the realm of international relations, where governments perceive technology as a source of power and wealth and a symbol of relative position and modernity.  Yet for centuries skeptics have questioned the economic rationale of government technology policies.  Still, to this day, countries support emulation, innovation and a host of other strategies as means for catching up with leading nations or locking in current advantages.  What lies behind such policies?  What do they accomplish?  And what are the domestic and international politics surrounding them? After reading classic arguments, including texts by Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List, students will consider 20th and 21st century debates and an array of experiments tried by poor, middle-income and rich countries.  Cases include the development of new industries; the imposition of sanctions; the dilemma of dual technologies and military spillovers; the forging of national champions; the reorganization of banks and the creation of international financial centers; the copying of regional clusters (e.g. Silicon Valley) and stock markets (e.g. the Nasdaq); and the extraterritorial extension of domestic regulation and governance techniques.

In this course we will challenge the assumption that the outcome of these three transitions will be a strong, democratic, capitalist country. We will ask whether civil war, organized crime, an immature party system, poor social services, and nomenklatura privatization bode poorly for these three transformations.
Offered as"
POSC,478,International Relations Theory,3,"This course is a seminar in international relations theory. As such, we will bring a wide range of theoretical perspectives to bear on issues and debates in the area of international relations by systematically studying the evolution of the world system.  The seminar is roughly divided into a first half focusing on war and the political system, and a second half focusing on trade, finance and the economic system.  Each section devotes particular attention to ethical problems associated with political and economic issues.

POSC,479,Introduction to Middle East Politics,3,"This is an introductory course about Middle East Politics, in regional as well as international aspects.  In this course we will explore broad social, economic, and political themes that have defined the region since the end of World War Two.  Since this is an introductory course, a major goal will be to gain comparative knowledge about the region's states and peoples.  The countries that comprise the modern Middle East are quite diverse; therefore, we will only be able to focus on a few cases in depth.  A second goal is to use the tools and theories social scientists employ to answer broad questions related to the region, such as: How have colonial legacies shaped political and economic development in the Middle East?  How do oil, religion, and identity interact with politics?  How have external powers affected the region's political development?  What do the uprisings of 2011 hold for the region's future?

POSC,485,Doing Government Work: Public Administration in the U,S,"This course focuses on how governments, particularly governments in the United States, do their work.  The topic is often called ""public administration,"" or ""implementation,"" or ""bureaucratic politics.""  It involves what James Q. Wilson calls government ""operators"" such as teachers, public health doctors, agricultural extension agents, grant administrators and Seal teams.  Their actions depend on their own values; conflict among political authorities, and on what is needed to perform specific tasks.  We will begin by discussing the challenges of organizing to do anything, or organization theory; turn to the peculiar political context of administration in the United States; and apply these understandings to specific government activities.  Students should emerge with a better understanding of why government agencies do what they do, and why they succeed or fail.
Offered as"
POSC,486,Making Public Policy,3,"Politics is about who wins, who loses, and why.  Policy, by contrast, is often depicted as more ""neutral;"" policies are the means through which political decisions are carried out.  In this class, we examine the notion that policy is the rational, impartial counterpart to the political arena.  We will ask: How are public policies made?  Why do some issues make it on to the agenda, while others do not?  Can we separate facts from values, or are both always contested?  We will examine how decision-making in a group introduces distinct challenges for policymaking.  The course focuses on widely applicable themes of policymaking, drawing on both domestic and international examples.
Offered as"
POSC,488,"Politics, Policy, and the Global Environment",3,"This course examines the law, politics and policy surrounding global environmental challenges such as climate change.  The course aims to provide a broad overview of the key concepts, actors, debates, and issues in global environmental politics.  It aims to illustrate the complexities of addressing environmental problems-from the proliferation of global institutions and international actors, to the absence of central enforcement mechanisms.  We examine the causes of environmental degradation and competing views on the gravity of the problem.  Using concepts from political science and economics, we investigate the challenges in getting states to act jointly to address environmental problems.  We examine the actors and institutions of global environmental politics, to understand how conditions are defined as problems and responses are chosen and implemented.  The course concludes by applying the tools and concepts to the case of climate change.

PHOL,478,Lifestyle Medicine,3,"While the current acute care model of medicine focuses on disease and treatment of individual organ systems by specialists, 50-60% of the public use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which focuses on prevention rather than disease. In CAM, damage caused by Western diets is avoided with low fat, vegetarian, or vegan diets, and with herbs and supplements. Damage mediated by emotional responses to stress is counteracted with relaxation practices such as yoga, meditation or hypnosis. In support of CAM, NIH-funded research performed over the past decade has shown that 70-90% of chronic diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer result from lifestyle. Moreover, mechanisms of lifestyle-induced disease as well as mechanisms by which these can be prevented or reversed by CAM practices have been described. This course examines interrelationships between lifestyle, health and disease and influences of CAM practices in terms of physiological health. Topics include evidence that Western diets, chronic emotional stress resulting from pervasive environmental, societal, workplace, financial, or relationship issues, and changes in circadian rhythms resulting from behaviors such as not getting enough sleep or working night-shifts facilitate disease by inducing cellular events that include epigenetic modification, changes in gene expression, and decreased telomere length. Mechanisms by which CAM practices prevent or reverse these lifestyle-mediated changes are also covered. In addition, the course considers the broader issue of how economic and political pressures are forcing rapid changes in healthcare and the influence that lifestyle-based approaches is likely to have on evolving delivery models, healthcare costs, and public health policies.

PHOL,481,Medical Physiology I,6,"Physiology is the dynamic study of life.  It describes the vital functions of living organisms and their organs, cells, and molecules.  For some, physiology is the function of the whole person.  For many practicing clinicians, physiology is the function of an individual organ system.

More specifically, they are responsible for designing, running, controlling and improving the systems that accomplish production.  This course is a broad-spectrum course with emphasis on techniques helpful to the practice of management at the analyst level.  Its goal is to introduce you to the environments, to help you appreciate the problems that operations managers are confronted with, and provide you with the tools to address these problems.  Operations Management spans all value-adding activities of an organization including product and process design, production, service delivery, distribution network and customer order management.  As global competition in both goods and services increases, a firm's survival depends upon how well it structures its operations to respond quickly to changing consumer needs.  Thus, it is essential for all business managers to acquire an understanding of operations management to maintain their competitive advantage.  This course provides students with the basic tools needed to become an analyst in Supply Chain and Operations Management.  This course provides an overview of Process analysis, Capacity management, Queuing system, analysis, Forecasting, Quality management, Material Requirements planning, Inventory management, and Supply Chain management.  The emphasis of the course is on both real world applications and technical problem solving.  Several manufacturing and non-manufacturing environments will be discussed explicitly, like health care, insurance, hotel-management, airlines and government related operations.

MSFI,493,Blockchains and AI: Applications in Finance and Business,3,"It behooves today's business leaders to be well acquainted with blockchain technologies and AI (Artificial Intelligence), two seemingly disparate technologies that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt a wide range of businesses.
The popularity of blockchain technologies has increased exponentially since the release of bitcoin in 2009. While bitcoins garnered a lot of attention during the initial days, the focus has shifted over time to the underlying technology: blockchain. This wildly innovative technology has made possible tasks that were hitherto deemed implausible: validate ownership in a digital asset, verify the true state of a transaction without relying on a costly intermediary etc. The list of businesses that are impacted by this technology makes for an impressive reading: supply chain, health care, insurance, foreign exchange transfers, real estate, etc.
If the emphasis of blockchain technology is on trust, that of Artificial Intelligence is on predictions. Accurate predictions and sound judgements are two critical ingredients of any decision making process. While the jury is still out on whether algorithms can make sound judgements, recent developments in a field called machine learning (and its sub-field, deep learning) have led to dramatic improvements in the accuracy of predictions made by these algorithms. Significantly, this gain in accuracy has been accompanied by a reduction in overall costs. These in turn have spurred the recent interest in AI. Organizations that have enabled AI at the enterprise level appear to be making more informed decisions and innovating new products. 
In this course, we will unpack these technologies and examine a wide range of relevant business use cases. Our objective is to provide a practical introduction to these key technologies and their business implications. We focus on business perspectives, rather than on the technical dimensions. Fittingly, this course is open to all graduate students of Weatherhead School (MBA and all specialty Masters). Students are not expected to have any specific programming background; however, a basic understanding of statistics is required to better appreciate the discourse on Artificial Intelligence.

MGRD,610,Internship in Biomedical Sciences,1 - 9,"This course is an ungraded (pass/fail) internship.  Students are expected to identify a potential internship that will enhance their career in a meaningful way.  For example, a student interested in education might choose to work with the Great Lakes Science Center to develop and help deliver content for a medical-themed summer camp.  Students interested in getting a job in industry may find a company in their field and intern with them.  Research experiences within CWRU or affiliated hospitals MAY be appropriate only if the student wouldn't otherwise get those experiences in their program and it would significantly help their career.  Therefore, all internships must be identified and approved by the course director and, if counting as an elective toward their degree, their program director, prior to enrolling.  
All students must identify an internship mentor at the location of their internship.  The course director will check in with their mentor regularly to ensure an appropriate experience for student as well as the hosting institution.  
Credits depend on the scope of the internship.  For each credit you are enrolled in, you will be expected to work at least 50 hours.  So, in other words, if you register for 9 credits in one semester, you will be expected to work a total of at least 450 hours, or about 11-12 weeks full time.  Thus, the number of credits registered should coincide with the agreed upon scope of the internship.
In order to pass this course, students will be expected to keep, and submit weekly, a reflection log.  In addition, students will be expected to present on their experiences, including what they did and what they learned, at an end of the semester, and their internship mentor, program director and other students in this course will be invited to attend this public presentation.  Students who do not meet the criteria for hours worked, miss more than 2 of the weekly reflections or do not do an end of the semester presentation will receive a failing grade."

It combines analysis and synthesis to create opportunities for improvement and means of attaining them. Viewed this way, designing is a core competence of a successful entrepreneur or innovative leader. Design analysis is the systematic review of the four orders of design found in every firm--namely, the firm's communications, products, interactions and environments--and the creation of opportunities to increase firm value by improving each. Students will identify ill-defined, ill-structured problems within organizations. Such problems are ones for which there are no definitive formulations and for which the formulation chosen affects the solutions available. For such problems, there is no explicit way of knowing when you have reached a solution, and solutions cannot necessarily be considered correct or incorrect. But finding innovative solutions to such problems can provide unique opportunities to create exceptional value.  A major outcome of the semester's inquiry is a presentation of the design problem and proposed design solution.

IIME,450A,Technology Entrepreneurship: Market Opportunity Analysis,3,"The nature and importance of entrepreneurship is an area of importance to business leaders, educators, politicians, and individual members of the society. It is a driver of economic development and wealth creation in organization units ranging in size from the individual company to entire nations. Technology-based entrepreneurship is particularly important to this economic development due to its impact on productivity and its potential for exponential growth. To create something new and of value to both the organization and the market requires a technical individual who is willing to assume the social, psychic, and financial risks involved and achieve the resulting rewards whether these be monetary, personal satisfaction, or independence. This can occur while starting an enterprise (i.e., entrepreneurship) or while driving innovation in an existing organization (intrapreneurship). This course will also take students through a variety of issues related to enhancing innovation in the context of a technology-based organization. This is sometimes termed intrapreneurship and includes innovating new products and services within an organization. This is a very complex field and relatively young. Students will learn that there are not many ""absolute truths,"" but there are numerous best practices and benchmarks that can assist the intrapreneur.

IIME,473,Fundamentals of Clinical Information Systems,3,"Technology has played a significant role in the evolution of medical science and treatment.  While we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  Information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  This introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (CIS).  Often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the ""art"" of CIS more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  In this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (A) operational and strategic information needs, (B) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (C) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.  Legal and ethical issues are explored.  The student learns the process of ""plan, design, implement"" through hands-on applications to select CIS problems, while at the same time gaining insights and understanding of the impacts placed on patients and health care providers.

HSMC,411,Identifying Design Opportunities,3,"Designing is giving form to an idea for a more desirable product, service, process or organization, and refining the idea into something that can be delivered reliably and efficiently. Good design integrates these evolving ideas with the day-to-day realities of a firms' operations, systems, marketing, economics, finance and human resources. Designing is thus a unique managerial activity that brings together changing technologies, capabilities, relationships, activities and materials to shape an organization's plans and strategies. It combines analysis and synthesis to create opportunities for improvement and means of attaining them. Viewed this way, designing is a core competence of a successful entrepreneur or innovative leader. Design analysis is the systematic review of the four orders of design found in every firm--namely, the firm's communications, products, interactions and environments--and the creation of opportunities to increase firm value by improving each. Students will identify ill-defined, ill-structured problems within organizations. Such problems are ones for which there are no definitive formulations and for which the formulation chosen affects the solutions available. For such problems, there is no explicit way of knowing when you have reached a solution, and solutions cannot necessarily be considered correct or incorrect. But finding innovative solutions to such problems can provide unique opportunities to create exceptional value. A major outcome of the semester's inquiry is a presentation of the design problem and proposed design solution.
Prereq: MSM Healthcare Students only."
HSMC,412,Lean Services Operations,3,"The course will be delivered over four modules: 1) Service Process Blueprints, 2) Managing Capacity in Service Systems, 3) Mapping the Value Stream (current and future state), and 4) Inventory Management in Service Systems. The topics considered are viewed in the context of healthcare management, financial services, insurance firms, call centers, back-office operations, and other applications. 

Through these topics, the participants will be trained in tools that help them understand customers' expectations and needs and to identify service system characteristics that can meet these needs. We will learn how to identify errors in service and troubleshoot these problems by identifying the root causes of errors. Subsequently, we will discuss how one can modify the product or service design so as to prevent defects from occurring. Finally, we will establish performance metrics that help evaluate the effectiveness of the Lean system in place. These efforts will result to improved quality. 

This course is not oriented toward specialists in service management. Its goal is to introduce you to the environments and help you appreciate the problems that operations managers are confronted with. Then, we will typically discuss some system specifics and emphasize the principles and issues that play key role in their management.

It begins with some background coverage of the colonial period (1607-1763), but focuses primarily on the underlying causes of the American Revolution, the chain of events leading to the Declaration of Independence, the war with England, postwar conflicts of the 1780s, the Constitutional Convention, and the ratification struggle that followed, with a look forward to the so-called Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.  Lectures, readings, and discussions explore the Revolutionary crisis as a complex, multi-racial, transatlantic struggle involving Native Americans, African Americans (enslaved and free), poor whites, wealthy Anglo-American planters and merchants, Scottish traders, and British administrators, as well as multi-racial and multi-national military forces organized on radically opposing principles.

This course traces Europe's transition from a continent of sovereign nation-states or empires ruled by monarchs with starkly hierarchical social structures, through wars, revolution, dictatorships, destruction, division, and destitution, to a conflicted present. The contradictory combination of peace, freedom, and pluralism combined with cultural critique of the very consumer society that has reduced conflict challenges students' linear notions of historical development.

Tracking peregrinations out of the Iberian Peninsula to the British Isles, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, Poland-Lithuania, the Ottoman Empire, and the American colonies, it examines the diverse ways Jews organized their communities, interacted with their non-Jewish neighbors, and negotiated their social, economic, and legal status within different states and empires.  What role did Jews play and what symbolic place did they occupy during a period of European expansion, technological innovation, artistic experimentation, and religious and political turmoil?  What internal and external dynamics affected Jewish experiences in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries?  Through a selection of inquisitorial transcripts, government records, memoirs, and historical literature, we will explore topics such as persecution, conversion, messianism, toleration, emancipation, and assimilation.

HSTY,219,Berlin in the Tumultuous 20th Century,3,"The tumultuous but short twentieth century began and ended with a united Germany, with Berlin as its capital. But in between, Berlin, and Berliners, experienced the extremes of the economic, technological, and cultural progress that the century brought, and the devastation, violence, division, and uncertainty that it also brought.
This course, taught with Berlin as its laboratory, introduces students to the German tumult of the twentieth century. We will read about historical events and developments, and then visit the places where those events and developments occurred. We will address persistent questions, such as why and how did Hitler come to power; what was life like behind the Berlin wall; why is there a Forever 21 across from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Memorial Church; how does one come to grips with a history like Germany's in the twentieth century; and what has life been like for ordinary Berliner/innen.
Students are welcome to take this course before they have any background or acquaintance with the German language, although the instructor expects students to be able to navigate independently in Berlin after he provides them with an introduction. German proficiency will enrich the student's experience in Berlin, and the instructor hopes that some of the students who enroll will already be pursuing the study of the German language. The instructor further hopes that students who have never before studies German language will be inspired to begin to learn German after they return to Case Western Reserve.

HSTY,220,The Early Modern Mediterranean,3,"For centuries before Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean, travelers and traders, pirates and pilgrims, mercenaries and missionaries explored the contours of the Mediterranean Sea--and engaged in commerce, as well as religious, economic and military competition. If religion and ethnicity divided Muslims, Christians and Jews from Algiers to Athens, did shared geography, foodstuffs, and cultural values bind them together? This course examines the unity and diversity of this maritime region by considering the peoples, beliefs, commodities and diseases that circulated through it during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Does the early modern Mediterranean showcase a clash of civilizations or provide an enduring model for coexistence? Topics include merchant culture, diplomacy, honor and shame, slavery and colonization.

HSTY,222,Becoming Ken Burns: An introduction to Public History,3,"This course focuses on the practice of public (applied) history in the United States.  Its purpose is to familiarize students with the background (historical and contemporary) of the manners in which history is taught and used outside of the school or college classroom as well to familiarize them with potential careers in public history, including museum work; editing; documentary film production; and the growing business of ""history for hire."" This overview will be complemented by an examination of a number of major issues in public history including the debate as to whether it can be as authoritative and insightful as academic scholarship, and the potential influences of the marketplace and politics on the topical focus and accuracy of public history ""products.""

HSTY,229,Asian Christianity: Historical Perspectives,3,"The history of Christianity in Asia is as old as the history of Christianity itself. But while much has been told about Christianity as it grew from an obscure Jewish sect to mighty Western Christendom, not enough attention has been given to the Christianity which spread eastwards to Asia in the first millennium of the Christian era. This course seeks to correct the imbalance by introducing students to a historical exploration of the eastward movement of Christianity from Jerusalem to different parts of Asia. Topics include the Assyrian Church of the East in Persia, India and China, European Catholic and Protestant colonial missions in the age of European imperialism, and the Jesuit missions to Japan and China.

HSTY,234,France and Islam,3,"This seminar examines French encounters with the Muslim world from the Middle Ages to the present. Over the last millennium, France has viewed Saracens, Moriscos, Turks, Berbers, and Arabs with admiration and fear, disdain and incomprehension. Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, French soldiers battled in the Holy Land; for several hundred years after that, France and the Ottoman Empire exchanged diplomats, traders and slaves. The colonial occupation of Algeria that began in 1830 ended violently in 1962. By then, the empire that struck back had also come home through large waves of immigration. Today, the social and economic status, religious affiliation, political significance and cultural impact of French citizens of North African descent are the subject of burning national debate. Taking a long view on Franco-Muslim relations, the course will explore such topics as the Crusades, Mediterranean piracy and captivity, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, the Algerian War of Independence, the ""veil affair,"" riots in the suburbs of Paris and World Cup soccer.

HSTY,235,Pirates in the Early Modern World,3,"From the Caribbean to Somalia, pirates have captivated the American imagination.  Beyond examining images of heroic outlaws and bloodthirsty criminals in popular culture and current affairs, this course investigates maritime predators of the early modern period (16th-18th centuries).  With a focus on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic--and forays into the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and elsewhere--it considers the motivations and strategies of sea robbers and the responses of states.  What, it asks, can Barbary corsairs, Dutch freebooters, Spanish ""sea dogs,"" and Catholic privateers, teach us about social rebellion, religious conflict, economic development, political authority, legal norms, naval power and imperial expansion? Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."
HSTY,236,World War I: Crucible of the 20th Century,3,"World War I changed everything about Europe and ushered in a changed century of tumult, war, and division.  The European experience of the regimentation of the economy and daily life, the impact of new technology on warfare, and the very personal suffering of separation and loss changed how those on that continent viewed their countries and their world.  The war affected everything from gender relations to class relations to religious and ethnic relations and laid the foundation for even more disruption ahead.  Its legacy reaches our day and colors our own views of what is normal and what is possible.  This course will explore those multiple and manifold legacies of this founding experience of modernity. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."
HSTY,237,WWII from the British Empire Perspective,3,"This lecture and discussion course gives students the opportunity to learn about the Second World War from the perspective of the British and their soldiery from around the globe. Many might come to the course with images of the American ""Bands of Brothers"" fighting across France in 1944. But that was the end of the war. In the beginning, it fell to the British leadership (famously embodied by Winston Churchill), British people, and to an extraordinary extent the Indian Army to withstand a pummeling at the hands of the Axis powers long enough for America to join the conflict. The course will examine those in Britain who might have preferred a move towards Fascism in the late 1930s. It will investigate why imperial subjects who lacked democracy in their own lands fought for the British in the name of democracy against totalitarianism. And it will scrutinize those in the Empire who instead sided with the Axis. In sum, students will have an opportunity to learn what led to those many moments of choice and chance that led to Allied victory and the defeat of Fascism. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."
HSTY,240,Shopping for Change: Consumer Culture and Social Movements in America,3,"Consumption has been central to American political, economic, and social life. Americans have engaged in individual and collective action as consumers to fight corporate malfeasance, to influence legislators, and to assert consumers' rights. Yet being a consumer is also a political practice, and forms of consumer activism have been central to some of the most important struggles for social justice, political rights, and freedom in America. This seminar examines the connections between consumption and politics by looking at the role that consumer identities and activism played in various social movements throughout the twentieth century, from the Kosher Meat Boycott of 1902 to the present. By reading primary and secondary sources, we will examine how consumption was a means to challenge gender, race, and class barriers, to claim equality and citizenship, and to fight social injustice. However, in looking at these struggles over access, control, and rights, we will also examine how the focus on consumption was used to co-opt subversive political messages and to contain radicalism."
HSTY,243,The Age of Prozac: Social and Cultural Aspects of Depression,3,"Although often experienced as an intensely individual, private, and painfully isolated affliction, depression has profound social and cultural dimensions.  This course will neglect neither biological (neurochemical or genetic) perspectives, nor personal or psychological aspects, but will emphasize perspectives derived from history, anthropology, and sociology.  While there may be tangential attention to bi-polar disorder (""manic depression""), the emphasis will be on unipolar depression.  The course will conclude with an in-depth exploration of the rise of pharmaceutical treatments."
HSTY,245,History of Capitalism,3,"This course will explore the history of capitalism, from its origins to its recent past, from different angles.

HSTY,248,Digital History Internship with the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History,3,"This directed digital history internship focuses on familiarizing students with the evolving nature of on-line, vetted historical resources, most particularly encyclopedias and other multi-authored datasets, and providing experience in expanding and maintaining a major web-based historical resource.  Students will work with the editor (the instructor for the course) and the graduate student associate editors of the on-line edition of the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History (https://case.edu/ech/) in creating new content for the on-line edition of the Encyclopedia and in modifying and enhancing its website, as well as assisting with the management of its social media components.  The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History was the first urban encyclopedia on the Web, and today its site averages over 800,000 ""hits"" per month.

Work on the Encyclopedia will be complemented by weekly assigned readings relating to the evolution of digitally-based historical works and more generally to the issues of professional authority and veracity that have come to complicate historical discourse on the Web.  These readings will serve as the basis for a seminar-style weekly meeting and for a topically focused research paper due at the end of the semester.  The internship itself will require students to research and write at least ten new short entries for inclusion in the Encyclopedia; to assist the staff in preparing social media announcements; and to engage as needed in modifying the website."

HSTY,321,"The Archaeology of Iron Age Italy and Sicily, ca",1000-300,"This course traces the early history and archaeology of the Italian peninsula and Sicily from ca. 1000 BCE to 300 BCE.  During this period, the movement of people brought with a transfer of people, ideas, and culture (both social and material) that would transform the population and landscape of ancient Italy and Sicily. We will look first at Southern Italy and Sicily, where, from about 750 BCE, Greek and Phoenician colonists settled.  We will examine the characteristics of Greek and Phoenician colonies and monuments, as well as the characteristics of the interactions between the new arrivals and the indigenous population, especially the Sikels.  We will then examine how the Villanovan culture was supplanted by the Etruscans in west-central Italy.  Through the close examination of the material culture we will address topics such as status, urbanization, religion and ritual, and the cultures of Italy and Sicily within the wider Mediterranean world.  Finally, we will look at another movement of people and politics: the expansion of Roman hegemony throughout the peninsula.  Numerous theories attempt to explain the effect Roman occupation had on the other populations.  We will analyze critically these theories and look for ourselves on the numerous ways indigenous populations could respond to ""foreign"" occupiers and how the occupiers responded to the indigenes.  We will ""read"" material culture almost like text, guided by concepts such as ""style,"" ""agency"" and ""habitus"" among others.  Through these lenses we will examine the archaeological material from multiple points of view (social, economic, religious, political). In turn, recent theoretical advances that seek to explain the processes of accommodation and emulation of, and resistance to, outside cultural influences will be looked at with a critical eye so that we can come away with fresh ideas about understanding what, and who, culture really is.

Beginning with the presumptions of classical liberal political economy, Marx employed his technique of the materialist dialectic to unmask, in his view, the contradictions and structural limitations that the capitalist mode of production imposed upon capitalists and proletarians alike.

HSTY,338,History of the American West,3,"The U.S. West has meant many things throughout American history--early explorers called it the Great American Desert, railroad boosters lured settlers to it by promising to make the arid land bloom into an agricultural Eden, urban immigrants looked to its limitless stretches of land as an escape from industrial labor, children read dime novels that glorified its heroes, and millions of tourists celebrate its raw beauty by visiting Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon.

HSTY,339,"The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1900-1948",3,"The British Empire took control of Palestine after driving the Germans and Turks from the region near the end of World War I.  From that moment on, the British had an increasingly difficult time administering the region.  Jewish colonists had already been settling in the land for decades, and with their takeover, the British gave them and other Zionists reason to believe that the Empire would facilitate Jewish efforts.  At the same time, the indigenous Arabs of Palestine appealed to the British to protect their very birthright, to keep their country from passing into someone else's hands.  The British gave Arabs, too, reason to believe that they would recognize and defend their claims.  In the few decades that the British Mandate governed Palestine it oversaw riots, revolution, and terrorist bombings.  When it withdrew from Palestine, its legacy was a brutal war between Arabs and Jews; and the legacy of that war holds an iron grip on the course of world history to this day.  Had the British Empire not been in Palestine, and not made the fateful decisions that it did, there would be no Israel and no Arab-Israeli conflict as we know them.  Course materials include histories of Zionism, pre-Zionist Palestine, the British Mandate years, the British Empire in other Arab lands, and the 1948 war and aftermath.  Primary sources from the perspective British officials on the ground in Palestine receive much attention.  The histories of engineering and agriculture are highlighted alongside traditional social and political perspectives. Counts as SAGES Departmental Seminar.

HSTY,346,"Guns, Germs, and Steel",3,"Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel won the Pulitzer for non-fiction in 1998.  Diamond, a physiologist, explains that Western Europe came to occupy and dominate large areas of the globe because of natural resources present in certain regions of the Old World since the end of the last Ice Age.  Where a historian might look for answers in the written evidence left by historical individuals, Diamond examines ancient patterns of plant diffusion or the place of mountain ranges and deserts in the development of technologies.  This seminar is about applying the history of a specific time and place namely North America from European contact to 1850 - to Diamond's general environmental explanations and models.  Placing Diamond's broad explanations within specific historical contexts is revealing.  A range of alternative methods, perspectives, primary sources from North America, and case studies (especially within environmental history) help develop a critical understanding of the complexities of European expansion into the New World.  The course engages in an extended comparative exploration of the worldviews of different world cultures, most extensively comparing European worldviews with Native American, but also paying significant attention to Asian worldviews.

HSTY,387,Growing Up in America: 1607 - 2000,3,"Children have been growing up in the United States since it was declared independent, in 1776, but how adults conceive of (and therefore legislate and interpret) children and childhood constantly changes to fit current circumstances.  The experiences of children themselves have varied not only in terms of race, class, gender, and religion but also depending on specific events (i.e., coming of age during the Civil War versus the Civil Rights movement) or geography (i.e., growing up in rural Hawaii vs. urban New Jersey).  We cannot cover all of those histories in one course, so this seminar course instead focuses on exploring the interplay of ideas about children and the expressed or historical experiences of children.  When the puritans and plantations members (slave, bonded and free) came to the Atlantic shore, they brought with them particular ideas about what is meant to be a child, and to experience childhood.  They encountered already established residents who also had ideas about childhood.  How did those concepts adjust/meld/contrast over time, and how do we see those ideas reflected or reshaped by actual experiences?  This course engages particular lines of inquiry:  How and why do understanding about what is ""natural"" for children change over time?  How do variables like race, class, gender, etc., uphold effects the manifesting of such concepts?  What is the role of the state in children's lives and how has that changed over time?

FSSY,112,Shakespeare - Still a Hit,4,"What is the enduring appeal of the works of William Shakespeare?  Not only are the plays themselves popular today; there are also many film versions and adaptations, some recent and some dating back to the early days of cinema.  In this First Seminar, students will read approximately six Shakespeare plays, including at least one history, comedy, and tragedy.  In addition, they will view at least one film version or adaptation of each play.  With the help of Kelvin Smith Library, the films will be made available on streaming video with password-protected access, enabling students to view them when convenient and as often as necessary.  Since this class (like all First Seminars) is writing-intensive, students will complete four formal essays as well as frequent in-class writing activities.  There will also be in-class readings from the plays, discussions of the various film adaptations, and one or two short oral presentations or activities."
FSSY,113,Movies and Meaning,4,"This course explores methods for interpreting films.  To interpret a film is a more aggressive and creative activity than is simply viewing one.  How do critics and researchers of cinema  ""make meaning""?  What strategies do they use?  How does one mount a film interpretation that is both novel and persuasive?  The course will emphasize close reading of films as, each week, we screen a film and together discuss what meanings we can infer from it.  Also each week, we'll read an essay that offers an interpretation of the film.  We'll analyze the reading in light of our sense of the film under consideration.  Students will write short essays, approximately one every two weeks, in which they analyze the rhetorical and interpretive strategies of a given film analysis.  Students will share their essays with the class, and these readings will serve as bases for class discussions.  Final writing projects will consist of student interpretations of a film.  At least twice during the semester, the class will, in substitution for the weekly required evening screening, attend a film off campus--either at the Cleveland Cinematheque or at the Cleveland Museum of Art.  The course emphasizes writing instruction and discussion in a seminar format.  There will be required evening screenings each week."

This four-credit-hour course also provides an introduction to various dimensions of academic life. It will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry. Throughout the semester, we will foreground critical reading, thoughtful analysis, as well as written and oral communication."
FSSY,135,The Rest is Silence,4,"The purpose of this course is to examine a widespread yet under-examined agent of the symbolic world: silence. Without the delimiting, shaping power of silence, language would be a lump of indistinguishable sound. The title of the course comes from Shakespeare: specifically, Hamlet's last words. As we know, the rest (of Hamlet) isn't silence: the play goes on for many more lines, beginning with Horatio's well known valediction, ""Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:/And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"" Hamlet's last words give us a good view into the ambiguous nature of silence, the strange entanglement it has with boundaries, both formal, and metaphysical. We will study how silence is imbricated in different, even antithetical, practices: in the articulation of creative forms (with special attention to poetry); in methods of religious contemplation and meditation; as agent of ecological and political suppression; as sensory deprivation, or form of torture. Silence continuously challenges and reorients our symbolic projects. As Ana Maria Ochoa Gautier argues, it forces us to question ""the binary logic of apparent opposites by dissolving one into the other (presence as absence, emptiness as plenitude, quietness as expressivity, silence as intensity of life)."" What we can know or say about silence will emerge from an ongoing discussion of texts that engage its properties--its paradoxes--differently. Our semester-long study (and practice) of silence will draw on your powers of critical inquiry, reflection, and synthesis, as well as your powers of attention and imagination. Seminar-style discussion and writing are the cornerstones of the course, which is designed to help you locate yourself in the surrounding structures and expectations of the academic community, especially its forms of conversation and writing. My hope is that as you explore and refine your relationship with silence, you will begin to identify and conserve it as an important resource in your academic life: as a refuge from information overload, as a ground for ethical decision-making, and as a guide to precision in speech and writing."
FSSY,146,Doc Talk: Language & Medicine,4,"This course explores the role of language in constructing, experiencing, treating, and understanding the states we call ""health"" and ""illness."" We will ask questions such as: Why do we fight cancer but mend broken bones? When (and how) do some experiences (e.g., sadness, hunger) become symptoms of disease? Why do doctors ask where it hurts rather than when or how? Is there a difference between saying that a patient is ""med compliant"" and that she has ""taken her prescription medicines""? To answer these questions (and to ask dozens more), we will read primary research on medical language, visit several of Cleveland's nationally renowned cultural institutions, and discuss the symbolic and social meanings of a variety of medical terms, images, objects, and patterns of communication."
FSSY,147,Art and Physics,4,"The twentieth century's advances in physics, from relativity to quantum mechanics and string theory, have offered distinctly new ways of looking at ourselves and the world around us.  It is no surprise that they have equally impacted different branches of the arts, revealing new possibilities for what to represent and how to represent it.  This course intends to explore this relationship between physics and art by taking two of those signal advances -- Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- and considering how they inflect artistic models of expression such as painting (Cubism), music (atonal composition), and literature (postmodern metafiction).  Our goal is not to trace specific trains of influence (although they do exist) so much as to consider how parallel developments in the sciences and the arts emerge contemporaneously, and on that basis to reconstruct the conversation between them.  We will try to ask what each of these discursive models has to say to the others, and how the apparently unbridgeable gap between science and art might find some points of common contact."
FSSY,153,What is Mind?,4,"This seminar introduces students to the systematic study of the human mind, with a primary focus on general topics as the nature of perception, consciousness, intentionality, mental causation, and free will. In addition, we will take up the more specific topics of the transition from anatomically modern to behaviorally modern human beings, as well as debates over whether mind is identical with the brain, or if mind is an outcome of brains, body, and environment."
FSSY,154,The Imagination Project,4,"For the first years of our schooling, we are taught to play make-believe. Then, we are taught to understand facts. Whatever happened to the imagination? What is it? What are the theories that help to explain it? And what is its place at a research university?
In this class, we will read, talk, think, and write about the purposes and scope of the human imagination, which is often understood as the symbolic realm of images and ideas that exists as part of our mental life. We will look at how the imagination has been understood by various thinkers and artists, and we will consider how the physical world interacts with the imagination in stories, music, film, and scientific ideas. Even though we may think that imagination means ""something from nothing,"" it is much more complicated and collaborative than that, as we will see in our examination of larger imaginative projects such as the Sistine Chapel, Star Wars, Legos, and Disney World. We will examine the role of the imagination in as many disciplines as possible, including physics, sports, fantasy, politics, and the media. As we interrogate these sources, we will learn the basic tenets of argument and research that will help you in your upcoming SAGES courses. Are there imaginative practices that can help us succeed here at Case? How can we turn our own imaginations into reality?"
FSSY,157,Pursuits of Happiness,4,"What is Happiness?  And why do Americans consider its pursuit a self-evident, inalienable right?  To what extent is happiness a component of the American Dream?  How have writers used stories to illustrate the possibilities and limits of this ideal? This course examines the various ways that thinkers have defined happiness, using both theoretical frameworks and literary examples.  Students will carefully analyze the validity and utility of these models, selecting elements to construct their own personal philosophies of happiness."
FSSY,158,Ecology in American Literature and Film,4,"How can American literature and film help us understand environmental issues?  This course will explore that question by investigating several of the foundational texts of the ecology movement in the United States.  Many American authors and directors are sensitive to the natural beauty of the American continent and, therefore, emotionally and spiritually affected by environmental destruction.  Scientific and political questions will be important for our inquiries, but we will emphasize the cultural and spiritual aspects of environmental thinking.  While science strives to understand nature and provides data documenting environmental conditions, and politics should propose pragmatic solutions, the will to act on scientific facts or political ideas requires emotional and ethical engagement, which literature and film particularly stress.  The expressive content and moral messages in literary memoirs and films complement scientific work and politics by allowing us to reflect on an obligation to preserve the natural environment.  Consequently, this class will consider environmental awareness and the human connection to the natural world by examining writers' experiences.  Our exploration will also consider dystopian stories that imagine where environmental disasters might lead.  Possible texts include Walden, Desert Solitaire, A Sand County Almanac, and movies like Jeremiah Johnson, Into the Wild, and Wall-E."
FSSY,175,God and the American Writer,4,"How have American poets, novelists, and essayists thought about God? Do they have anything to teach us about the role of religious belief in a country where religious believers make up the statistical majority? What could a late nineteenth century poet possibly teach us about the ways Americans experience religious belief today? How could a fictional novel help us better understand the unique cultural history of religious belief in the US and its influence on today's society? 
This course seeks to address these questions by considering a particular strain of American writing that highly values the role of personal experience in religious faith. For these writers, God is not a philosophical idea hidden away in the abstractions of erudition, or a historical curiosity to be studied alongside ancient civilizations, but something to be experienced in an intense and personal way. For one writer God is the ""Tender Pioneer"" who Americans would be cowardly not to venture after. Another writer claims that the previous ""generations beheld God and nature face to face;"" he encourages his readers to ignore others' opinions and to seek their own ""original relation with the universe."" Another proclaims that Americans profess ""to love God whom they have not seen, while they hate their brother whom they have seen."" What similarities do these ideas share--what differences separate them? 
We will use these and other ideas to begin a conversation about why the personal experience of God seems so vital to America writers. We will discuss the ways American writers have created and critiqued the religious value of individuality, as well as how the category of ""personal experience"" can both hinder and help us in understanding American culture."
FSSY,177,Cosmic Horror,4,"Cosmic Horror is the literary genre that most powerfully wrestles with the question of humanity's place in the universe as revealed by modern science. From its shadowy beginnings in the pulp fiction magazines of the nineteen twenties and thirties, Cosmic Horror has come to occupy the center of contemporary literary culture. Prominent philosophers, ecologists, writers, and programmers have taken inspiration from the genre as they seek to discover meaning in a universe no longer centered on humanity. These works explore a physical world indifferent to human life and human meaning, a world in which human action shrivels into insignificance when faced with the abysses of cosmic temporal and spatial scales. In reading writers such as H. P. Lovecraft and Octavia Butler, and philosophers and scientists such as Eugene Thacker and Carlo Rovelli, we will focus on several key questions. How does ""cosmic"" horror differ from other kinds of terror? What traditions, beliefs, or practices does modern science threaten for these writers? Why have so many thinkers from diverse fields found themselves drawn to these works in recent years? What resources do these works offer for making sense of the environmental crisis?

This class, like other First Seminars, is writing-intensive and will follow the seminar format. It is characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading from primary as well as secondary sources. This interdisciplinary course (investigating intersections of literature, philosophy, psychology, and science) will help you recognize the different perspectives that can be used to enter into a discussion on a subject, and enable you to make sometimes surprising connections across different fields, times, and genres."
FSSY,182,Mystery and the Art of Storytelling,4,"It's hard to resist a good story, and even harder to resist a good mystery story. What is it about mysteries that makes them so enduringly fascinating, so universal? What might they teach us about the nature of storytelling itself? In this course we'll discuss and write about how narrative works, taking mystery as our guide. In doing so, we'll also become better readers, viewers, and interpreters. For these stories make detectives out of us all, demanding that we evaluate textual evidence, seek out rhetorical clues, pay keen attention to detail, and even examine our own frameworks of perception. Engaging both classic and less traditional tales of mystery and detection (including a movie or two), we'll examine the logic of such narratives, the desires and fears that drive them, and the secrets they tell--or try to keep hidden."
FSSY,183,E-Lit:  New Media Narrative,4,"Imagine a book we might read by touching the words, choosing among possible paths or endings, or even by allowing our own faces or voices to be part of the scene.  Electronic literature, that is, literary works designed to be read or experienced on a computer, often requires exactly such multisensory engagement, asking readers to make unusual connections between words, images, sounds, or movement, and, sometimes, to put themselves into the story.  In this class, we will read, experience, and write critically about electronic literature and experimental print literature, including works of interactive fiction, digital documentary, blogs, cut up and computer-generated poetry, digital games, and geo-locative fiction.  The works we read present unfamiliar, often non-linear, modes of writing, storytelling, or of conveying information.  Such texts give us insight into how we ""read"" and how digital spaces influence the way we understand, experience, and respond to ideas, places, and people."
FSSY,185B,Jazz Attitudes,4,"Despised by the church, reviled by New Orleans society, Jazz was the bad boy music of the early 20th century.  But by WWII it was the most popular music style in the US. Since then, jazz has become a minority taste, embraced by the academy, but viewed with an intimidated indifference by the general public. How did this happen? How have views of this odd marriage of European and African musical styles changed through the years?  Can jazz regain relevancy? Should jazz musicians even care about relevancy? And if not, what does the future hold for them and their music? In this course, we will examine the history of the development of jazz, what makes the music so important in American culture, and some of the reasons why--despite this importance--few people listen to it anymore. Students need not have prior familiarity with jazz, only a willingness to listen to, and read about, the music."
FSSY,185D,Medieval Mindsets,4,"Do we get to be modern without first getting medieval? This seminar revisits and reexamines medieval modes of thinking and making. Over the course of the semester, we will sample literary and material artifacts left behind by the medieval world. We will reconsider our obligations to the past and its stuff, are we responsible for/to medieval things and, if so, to what degree? We will take a hands-on approach to our objects of study. Working in special collections and museums, with curators and artists, we will learn to decode medieval archives and artifacts. Together, we will put medieval mindsets to the test."
FSSY,185E,Literary Servants:  From Homer to Harry Potter,4,"Servants have played a surprisingly large role in some of the great works of Western literature, though they often get overlooked in favor of their more noble masters and employers. In ""The Odyssey,"" for example, when Odysseus returns from the Trojan War after 20 years at sea, he first gets recognized, not by his son or his wife, but by a childhood nurse who has served in his household all of his life. Shakespearean-era plays also place servants in surprisingly central roles, having them not only performing tasks for their masters, but sometimes acting as romantic interests and close friends, or emblems of moral behavior. Servants have taken on the role of primary protagonists in many works of 19th- and 20th-century literature, and have played an outsized role in countless other works. Some of the questions that we will ask in this class include: Why do these characters--who occupy the margins of the household and often perform seemingly mundane jobs--play this role in the literary and social imagination? Do servants have unique identities, interests, and value systems or do they adopt the identities and values of the people they serve? To what extent are servants needed to establish the social positions of patriarchs, monarchs and the wealthy? The class will also explore the forms of power that servants are able to exert over those that they serve, and the extent to which this power both complicates and reinforces more commonly recognized systems of inequality like race, class and gender. Readings will include several classic works of literature, and short philosophical works on human rights and the politics of the lower classes. We will also read some philosophical discussions of class and social hierarchy, watch and discuss some film and television representations of service, and visit the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Cleveland Historical Society in order to learn about the history of domestic service."
FSSY,185K,The Greek and Roman Humanities,4,"The civilizations that developed in ancient Greece and ancient Italy are called collectively ""Classical Civilization."" The study of the Greek and Roman humanities (languages, literature, arts, history, and philosophy) is known as ""Classics.""  The Greeks and Romans have had a profound, widespread, and long-lasting influence on many aspects of subsequent Western Civilization, so studying the Classical Humanities is not only a rewarding endeavor in itself, but also can benefit those who want a deeper understanding of the modern arts and humanities. In this seminar we will read and discuss representative works by Greek and Roman authors in translation and look at artifacts produced in the ancient world in order to come to a better understanding of the foundations of the western humanities. We will also study the impact of Greek and Latin on English in order to understand how language can shape thought--an important thing to learn for anyone who is also trying to become a better writer! 
The seminar will investigate numerous questions about Classics. Where were the Classical lands? When was the Classical period? Are there connections between Greece or Rome and other ancient civilizations? What were the sounds and sights of Greece and Rome? What remains of the ancient world in terms of language, literature, the arts? How have the Classical Humanities shaped modern concepts and institutions? Where can one find tangible influences of Greek and Roman civilization in modern America?  Why and when have modern people turned to Greece and Rome for inspiration?"
FSSY,185P,On the Road in America,4,"Travel and exploration have long occupied a central role in the American imagination. The idea of the frontier, and the great westward expansion, gave birth to national myths and narratives based on transit and adventure. In recent years, Americans have continued to reflect on the significance of physical journeys, as well as the inner quests that often accompany these modern-day pilgrimages. In this course, we will examine a diverse set of works that explore the long-standing American romance with adventure and movement. We will consider the impact of the open road on America's national identity, the powerful emotions and spiritual longing that lead people onto the road, and the forces that drive them off it."
FSSY,185Q,"Death, Mourning, and Immortality",4,"Although death and loss always have been part of the human experience, poems aching for immortality and mourning losses were especially important to people before the development of modern medicine because of the omnipresence of death in daily life. Poems mourning losses were frequently (but not always) about death, and so we will occasionally consider what it means to mourn a still-living hero or to mourn the passing of a moment in time. A poem can become a ""moment's monument"" in one apt description. In this seminar, we will examine poetry from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries to explore the variety of ways that writers' religious beliefs, gender and sexual identities, and attitudes about desire and emotion informed how they thought about death, loss, mourning, and immortality. How does this poetry represent sadness and despair? In what ways does it affirm the joys of life and the memory of what has been lost? To supplement our investigation, we will also explore expressions of mourning that can be found in other genres of literature, as well as in museums and cemeteries. We will think about what it means to write yourself or others into immortality. No prior experience studying poetry is necessary, only a willingness to read with care and think with an open mind."
FSSY,185R,Children's Picture Books,4,"Picture books may teach young readers basics like how to read, what sounds animals make, and how to count to ten, but they also shape children's perceptions of the world around them and influence the way they see themselves. In this seminar, we will study how children's picture books communicate social norms and ethics through the depiction of people and places. We will explore questions including: What kinds of places and spaces do picture books depict? How do characters treat others in these places, and how do they interact with non-human objects and the natural environment? Whose voices are heard and whose are silenced in the stories and pictures? Even though these books are written for children, what do they tell us about the adults who create, buy, or read them? How do these older readers understand children's spaces and childhood? By examining the underlying messages in these deceptively simple books, we can uncover surprisingly complicated visions of the world."
FSSY,185U,On Being Human,4,"This seminar explores religious and philosophical views about what it means to be human. We will address questions such as: to what extent are we free? Does freedom conflict with traditional authority, our own pasts, our irrational impulses, or our physical natures? What is the relationship between reason and emotion? How well do we know our own motives? And to what extent are we hidden to ourselves? To investigate these questions, we will read, discuss, and write about a range of classical and contemporary religious and philosophical thinkers. Each offers a different perspective about the nature of the human being, human excellence, and what it means to live a life of integrity. They are also enduringly relevant to our lives, inside and outside of the classroom. Together, the texts and thinkers constitute a conversation filled with sometimes competing and sometimes complementary views about who we are, why we do the things we do, and what sorts of lives we ought to lead."
EDMP,611,Theory and Practice of Collective Action,3,"The ability of autonomous and interdependent parties to coordinate actions, or to act cooperatively, affects a wide range of organizational and social problems. This course addresses the theory and practice of collective action in local, national and global contexts.  Case studies of collective action problems, such as environmental protection, community revitalization, and the mobilization of interest groups will be discussed.
Prereq: Must be enrolled in the DM Program."
EDMP,613,Leading Change,3,"Change is an enigma and yet sustained, desirable change (SDC) drives adaptation, growth and life itself.  In this course, we will continuously attempt to answer two questions: What is the process of sustained, desirable change?  and What is the role of a leader?  Concepts from complexity theory will be used, including understanding the multilevel nature of SDC at the individual, dyad,  team, organization, community, country, and global levels.  Intentional Change Theory (ICT) will be used as the organizing concept for the changes studied.  Leadership and its development will be examined by studying a number of topics and applying them to three major case studies: (1) yourself; (2) practice coaching with compassion; and (3) a major change project.  This course will explore questions, such as: Who are effective leaders?  How do they think and act?  What makes us want to follow them?  How are leaders developed?  What is the role of emotional and social intelligence?  How does a leader's mind, body, heart, and spirit affect their performance?
Prereq: Must be enrolled in the DM Program."
EDMP,614,Business as an Evolving Complex System,3,"The goal of this course is to provide a foundation for understanding how business systems evolve, why the business systems in the major advanced countries have evolved differently over the last 100 years or so, and what the underlying driving forces are.  The focus is on transformation rather than economic growth.  The course examines the evolution of business systems as a result of technological and organizational change.  It deals with the role of history, culture and finance in generating business organizations in various countries.  The course also studies the emergence of regional innovation systems and industry clusters, as well as how digitization and globalization are changing the ""industrial logic.""
Prereq: Must be enrolled in the DM Program."
EDMP,616,Global Economic Systems and Issues,3,"This course provides a framework and analytical tools for understanding globalization and international economic relations in the context of the global political system.  It analyzes the economic and political forces that are shaping global cooperation on economic matters, the role and impact of international economic institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization, and evolving forms of regional governance, such as the European Union.  It covers national and international policies and development and the causes and cures of international financial crises.  The course revolves around concepts of efficiency, equality, power, and institutions in the making of public policy towards globalization of communications and transportation.

Prereq: Must be enrolled in the DM Program."
EDMP,638,Qualitative Inquiry I,3,"This course explores ways to conceptualize an object of study and facilitates formulation of students' conceptual work and production of research reports at the end of the first year of the program.  The course conveys how to generate research ideas by critically reviewing literature and developing ideas that contribute to a problem or issue of interest by working with theory and extending previous research.  The practicality of conducting certain kinds of research is evaluated and length, intensity and ethical constraints of different research efforts are examined.  Each student produces a report communicating and supporting a conceptualization of the phenomenon of interest involving independent, mediating and dependent variables.   The paper defines a problem of practice, presents, both visually and in narrative form, concepts shaped by field experience and prior writing that promote understanding of the problem, and includes a research proposal describing sample, data collection and data analysis.
Prereq:"
EDMP,640,Social Ethics: Contemporary Issues,3,"The course draws upon intellectual ancestors and current thinkers in moral philosophy and ethics to assist each student in identifying, analyzing, and discussing social and ethical questions pertaining to the definition and purpose of contemporary life, the need for moral coherence, and the meaning of life in a global society.  The unifying theme of the course is Tolstoy's question, ""How then shall we live?""  The course does not seek to provide answers to the great questions of life.  Rather, it tries to expand each student's capacity to grapple with such questions.

The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.

ECON,102,Principles of Microeconomics,3,"This course is an introduction to microeconomic theory, providing a foundation for future study in economics. In particular, it addresses how individuals and businesses make choices concerning the use of scarce resources, how prices and incomes are determined in competitive markets, and how market power affects the prices and quantities of goods available to society. We will also examine the impact of government intervention in the economy."
ECON,103,Principles of Macroeconomics,3,"While Microeconomics looks at individual consumers and firms, Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. The focus of this class will be on the business cycle. Unemployment, inflation and national production all change with the business cycle. We will look at how these are measured, their past behavior and at theoretical models that attempt to explain this behavior. We will also look at the role of the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States in managing the business cycle."
ECON,307,Intermediate Macro Theory,3,"Macroeconomics studies aggregate indicators of the performance of an economy, most commonly measured in terms of GDP, and the rates of unemployment and inflation. An important goal of macroeconomic researchers is to develop a model of an economy that is simple, yet powerful enough to explain the historical trends of these aggregate economic indicators. Needless to say, coming up with a good model has remained a very difficult task. So far, there is no single model that is good enough to coherently explain even the most prominent historical trends of aggregate economic indicators. But several models have been built, each offering insight into a certain aspect of the economy. Throughout the course model building is motivated by real world cases from the American economy.
Prereq:"
ECON,308,Intermediate Micro Theory,3,This course builds on
ECON,309,Intermediate Micro Theory: Calculus-Based,3,"This course builds on Economics 102 and provides a more in-depth analysis of the theory of the consumer, the theory of the firm, market equilibrium, market failure and government intervention in the market.  We will use calculus to derive supply, demand and market equilibrium from first principles.  You should come away from this course with a greater understanding of how consumers and firms make their decisions and how they interact in the market place.  Note: a student cannot receive degree credit for both"
ECON,312,Entrepreneurial Finance - Undergraduate,3,"This course explores the financing and financial management of entrepreneurial new ventures. The course will focus on issues of financial management of new ventures (forecasting cash flows, cash flow management, valuation, capital structure) and the various financial methods and mechanisms available to entrepreneurs (bootstrapping, angel investors, venture capitalists, IPOs).
Offered as"
ECON,326,Econometrics,4,"Econometrics is the application of statistics to empirical economic analysis. One way of testing the validity of economic theories is to gather data and apply statistical tests to see if the data support the theory. These data are usually gathered by observing actual economies, firms and consumers, rather than by performing experiments in a laboratory. Because field data does not have the precision and control of laboratory data, analysts must compensate by adjusting their statistical procedures. In this class, we will concentrate on regression analysis, which is the basic tool of the economic researcher. We will study the assumptions commonly made in the application of this technique, the consequences of violating these assumptions, and the corrections that can be made. Students will have a chance to formulate and test their own hypotheses using econometric software available for personal computers.
Prereq:"
ECON,327,Advanced Econometrics,3,This class builds on the foundations of applied regression analysis developed in
ECON,328,"Designing Experiments for Social Science, Policy, and Management",3,"Both economists and firms are increasingly relying on experiments to study the economic behavior of individuals and the effectiveness of policies in a wide range of settings. This course gives students the tools they need to design and critique experiments that answer a research or business question. A small part of the class will be devoted to important theoretical concepts in experimental design, such as treatments, factorial designs, randomization, internal and external validity, biases, and inference problems. The bulk will be devoted to learning about how these concepts come together by discussing exciting new experimental work on topics such as discrimination and identity, cooperation versus self-interest, and dishonesty and corruption.
Prereq:"
ECON,329,Game Theory: The Economics of Thinking Strategically,3,"The term ""game theory"" refers to the set of tools economists use to think about strategic interactions among small groups of individuals and firms.  The primary purpose of this course is to introduce students to the basic concepts of game theory and its applications.  The class will stress the use of game theory as a tool for building models of important economic phenomena.  The class will also include a number of experiments designed to illustrate the game theoretic results, and to highlight how reality may depart from the theory.  The course will stress the value of thinking strategically and provide students with a framework for thinking strategically in their everyday lives.  Rather than approaching each strategic situation they encounter as a unique problem, students will be taught to recognize patterns in the situations they face and to generalize from specific experiences.  A paper on an application of game theory will be required for graduate students.
Offered as"
ECON,330,Economic Behavior and Psychology,3,"This course is an introduction to Behavioral Economics, a growing field which incorporates insights from other disciplines--primarily psychology-- into microeconomic models. We will cover fundamental aspects of decision-making, such as how people respond to risk, how people make trade-offs between short-term and long-term rewards, and the ways in which people aren't as selfish as standard economic models suggest. We will cover novel economic models that can accommodate phenomena such as altruism, loss aversion, and self-control problems. We will discuss empirical applications of these concepts in areas ranging from personal finance and health  to marketing and public policy.
Prereq:"
ECON,332,Economic Analysis of Labor Markets,3,"This course explores the economics of work and pay. We take a comprehensive look at labor markets in the U.S. and other advanced countries and examine related social policy issues. These include the effect of unions on wages; the underpinnings of the income distribution of the U.S.; issues of poverty and welfare; discrimination and wage differential by gender and race; the relationship between work and family; education as a determinant of wages; immigration and migration, and the way firms use wage and employment practices to motivate their employees to work productively. What makes labor economics special is that the commodity we examine is human labor, something that is central to the organization of our lives and the functioning of the economy. Labor economics thus applies the standard neoclassical model of demand, supply, and equilibrium to many areas that also have a profound human dimension.
Prereq:"
ECON,338,Law and Economics,3,"This course examines legal institutions and rules from an economic perspective. Students will learn when and how legal rules can be efficient. Topics will include property law (including intellectual property), tort law, contracts, and crime. Offered as"
ECON,341,Money and Banking,3,"This course emphasizes the importance of financial markets, the nature and role of the financial system, and the linkages between these--money and banking--and the economy.  Emphasis is placed on both theoretical and practical constructs, on major innovations and contemporary changes, and the closely intertwined condition of financial and economic systems with monetary and fiscal policy.
Offered as"
ECON,342,Public Finance,3,"Government intervention is a pervasive feature of every modern economy. The goal of this course is to develop the economic tools for understanding and evaluating a wide range of government behaviors such as taxation and redistribution policy, the public provision of goods and services, and the regulation of private markets."
ECON,346,Economic Perspectives,3,"This course examines important contemporary and historical issues from an economic perspective. It enables students to think about the world ""like an economist."" Possible topics of current interest include the transformation of Eastern Europe; ethnic and racial strife; environmental policy and sustainable development; and professional sports."
ECON,350,Regional and Urban Economics: The Case of Israel,3,"The goal of this course is to develop a deep understanding of core issue in regional and urban economics. Israel, by dint of its unique history and geo-political environment, provides a fascinating case study on the impact of refugees and immigration, urban planning and governance, security concerns, inequities and discrimination, labor force participation, poverty, environmentalism, and regional cooperation. This course provides a learning experience about these topics both via classroom time at Israeli universities and through visits to carefully chosen sites throughout the country. The trip includes a small amount of discretionary time for visiting spiritually significant sites as well. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement.
Prereq:"
ECON,351,Startup Nation Trip Course,3,"The course offers an opportunity to experience, first hand, Israel's raging start-up economy. Students will visit some of the country's hottest high-tech companies and meet face-to-face with top entrepreneurs and investors. The course will meet with prominent figures in the Israeli innovation scene, including directors of leading accelerators; top angel investors; leaders of corporate innovation; and representatives of governmental entrepreneurship agencies. Topics will include: the role of military in spurring innovation, public support for innovation, biotech, water, energy, cyber security, and new funding models.
Prereq:"
ECON,364,Economic Analysis of Business Strategies,3,"This course examines how companies compete against each other and interact with customers in an effort to increase profits.  Topics include: pricing strategies, product differentiation, advertising, R&D strategies, bundling and tie-ins, entry barriers, mergers and acquisitions, collusion and cartels, the dynamics of network industries (e.g. information technology), and technology adoption and diffusion.  The course will take two complementary perspectives.  First, we will consider the point of view of companies, and ask how different business strategies can affect competitive success.  Second, we will consider the perspective of consumers and policymakers: we will ask whether different firm strategies enhance or reduce social welfare, and will explore different policy options to increase welfare (e.g. antitrust policies, patent systems).  The first part of the course will utilize a range of basic economic tools.  In the second part of the course, we will apply what was learned in the first part to real examples of firms and industries, including both business and legal cases.
Prereq:"
ECON,368,Environmental Economics,3,"Economic models and reasoning provide a valuable lens through which to view many of the most intractable and perplexing environmental problems. The objective of this class is to apply the tools of a typical introductory or intermediate microeconomics course to topics involving the natural environment. That is, we  will  view environmental topics from the perspective of an economist. Topics that will be covered in this class include: market failure in the case of externalities and public goods provision; management of renewable resources; cost-effective pollution control; and energy use and global climate change.  Perhaps the most exciting part of this course is that we will take tools from the classroom and apply them to ongoing environmental questions. Lectures will include guest presentations from professionals who are actively working on environmental challenges. Offered as"
ECON,369,Economics of Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,3,"This course is designed to help students identify, evaluate, and obtain control over technological opportunities so they may successfully understand the challenges of starting new companies. The course focuses on four themes: 1) the source, discovery and evaluation of technological opportunities; 2) the process of organizing a new firm to produce new technology that satisfies the needs of customers; 3) the acquisition of financial and human resources necessary to exploit technological opportunities; and 4) the development of mechanism to appreciate the returns from exploitation of technological opportunities.

Prereq:"
ECON,374,Financial Regulation,3,"This course will provide students with an understanding of the economic underpinnings of financial regulation as it exists in the United States today.  The course will highlight salient aspects of financial markets, such as asymmetric information and the chains of exposures linking financial market participants, that make financial regulation both necessary and yet problematic.  Emphasis will be put on the difference between regulations on individual financial firms as compared with regulating for systemic financial stability.  The course will be designed to: (1) provide enhanced understanding of financial markets to undergraduate students who have already taken ECON"
ECON,375,Economics of Developing Countries,3,"This course focuses on international aspects of economic development. The term ""developing country"" is often defined as a country that exhibits low per capita income, high poverty level, low level of industrialization, or low life expectancy. In terms of size, the developing countries make up at least three-fourth of the world population. Why do we study those countries' economies separately from the industrialized economies? In fact, low economic growth, high unemployment, or high poverty rates also exist in many developed countries. The differences lie not in the types of problems but in the causes of these problems. In addition, differences in the kind of institutions that prevail in developing countries also lead to different policy prescriptions. Among developing countries, differences in historical experience, cultural practices, political institutions and economic conditions are also enormous. Illustrations and explanations of those differences are provided from a wide range of developing countries.
Prereq:"
ECON,376,Inside the Financial Crisis,3,"This is a case study in the events surrounding the 2007 global financial crisis. The course will build from fundamental economic concepts into a comprehensive analysis of the elements, which led to the collapse and the contemporary policy debates about the recovery. The background for debate will come from an analysis of: housing and housing finance; bank runs and Bear Sterns; mortgage backed securities; and toxic asset purchases. The course will then examine major components of the Dodd-Frank Act and enable students to assess whether the act will address the causes of the 2007 crisis and more importantly establish the conditions to prevent a future crisis.
Prereq:"
ECON,377,Topics in Monetary Policy,3,"Central banks have become enormously powerful economic institutions in many countries, yet their purposes and functions are widely misunderstood. This course is designed to enrich one's understanding of how central banks, such as the Federal Reserve System, actually operate; how they have been adapting to changes in the economic and financial landscape; and how they have been adapting to changes in technology. The course will highlight current monetary policy and central banking issues being dealt with in the United States and elsewhere. The course will emphasize the connection between economic theory and the practice of central banking. Where relevant, topics will be examined from a multi-country perspective, so that the practices of several different countries may be compared and contrasted.
Prereq:"
ECON,378,Health Care Economics,3,"Healthcare accounts for over one-sixth of the U.S. national economy and over one-eighth of its workforce, shares that have dramatically increased over the last 50 years. The rapid growth in healthcare spending has accompanied growing concerns about the quality and efficiency of U.S. healthcare delivery and persistent disparities in access to care. Are these concerns justified? If so, what can policymakers do - and what are they doing - to address them? The purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills necessary for understanding how the U.S. health care sector operates, how it has evolved, the forces at work behind perceived deficiencies (in access, quality and cost control), and the expected impact of alternative policy proposals. These issues are addressed through the lens of microeconomic theory. Under this framework, outcomes result from the interaction of decisions made by participants in the healthcare economy (e.g. patients, providers, insurers, government), with those decisions governed by the preferences, incentives and resource constraints facing each decision-maker. This course should be of particular interest to students who envision future careers in healthcare delivery, healthcare management, pharmaceutical and device innovation, health insurance or public health, as well as other policy-oriented students seeking to understand the contentious issues in healthcare policymaking.
Prereq:"
ECON,386,Urban Economics,3,"Microeconomic theory as taught in principles (and even intermediate) does not usually take into account the fact that goods, people, and information must travel in order to interact. Rather, markets are implicitly modeled as if everyone and everything is at a single point in space. In the first part of the course, we will examine the implications of spatial location for economic analysis. In the second part of the class, we will use microeconomic tools to understand urban problems. Topics that we will cover include urban growth, suburbanization, land use, poverty, housing, local government, transportation, education, and crime.
Prereq:"
ECON,391,Advanced Topics and Writing in Economics,3,"This course is characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading from primary and secondary sources, and will include extensive practice in written and oral communication.  The focus will be on contemporary economic issues and scholarship, and assumes a high level of ability in undergraduate economics training.  Specifically, this course provides an avenue for an intellectual discourse on some of the most challenging present day economic issues, and we will rigorously think and write about how economic concepts can be applied to virtually any topic, issue and event in the social world.  Students will be challenged throughout the course to think and write like an economist and see the world through the economist's lens. Counts as SAGES Departmental Seminar.
Prereq: "
ECON,395,The Economy in the American Century,3,"This class provides an approved SAGES capstone experience for economics majors.  It uses American economic history as an arena for a culminating application of the diverse knowledge and skills students have acquired during their undergraduate careers.  The twentieth century American economy was shaped by a series of transformations that make our lives profoundly different from those lived by Americans in 1900.  Attempting to understand these transformations has shaped the discipline of economics.  Events and processes such as mass migration, the Great Depression, the growth of women's participation in the workforce, and suburbanization generated questions that economists developed theories and bodies of empirical evidence to answer.  Students will synthesize knowledge accumulated in their prior undergraduate study to tackle big questions posed by the history of the American economy during the 20th century.  These questions cover the spectrum of economic life and scholarship, from finance and technology to human capital and gender.  Students form teams to tackle an important question developed in consultation with the instructor.  Each team will be responsible for educating the class on their research findings through researching and delivering a class-length presentation and preparing readings and exam questions.  Students will produce an individual final paper related to their team's topic that expresses their own scholarly perspective and interest. Counts as SAGES Senior Capstone.

ECON,431,Economics of Negotiation and Conflict Resolution,3,"Students frequently enroll in a negotiation class with one thought in mind--negotiating a better job offer from an employer. They soon learn, however, that negotiation skills can do far more than improve a paycheck. Negotiations occur everywhere: in marriages, in divorces, in small work teams, in large organizations, in getting a job, in losing a job, in deal making, in decision making, in board rooms, and in court rooms. The remarkable thing about negotiations is that, wherever they occur, they are governed by similar principles. The current wave of corporate restructuring makes the study of negotiations especially important for M.B.A.s. Mergers, acquisitions, downsizing and joint ventures call into question well established business and employment relationships. Navigating these choppy waters by building new relationships requires the negotiation skills that you will learn in this class.

DESN,308,Business Model Design and Innovation,3,"This course takes the perspective of entrepreneurs or business unit managers. The three basic questions that all entrepreneurs and intrepreneurs must answer is where to play, how to win and what to do.  You have identified a group of customers for your product or service (where to play).  Your first challenge is to know what features (Customer Attributes) your target customer will pay for. Innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call Focal Attributes. Your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  The concept called Profit Objectives (similar but not the same as KPI and/or SMART objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   Your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  At this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives. You will learn how to illustrate this alignment through a mapping process.

DESN,410,Leading Digital Innovation by Design,3,"A new wave of digital revolution is transforming every industrial sector. Powered by increasingly smaller yet potent microprocessors and sensors, a new generation of analytical tools, and ubiquitous wearable and mobile devices, companies can radically transform the way they interact with users and the way they create and capture value. Technology like Block Chain and AI are likely to fundamentally reshape how we think about firms and industries. Such changes make existing strategic frameworks and tools obsolete. In order to understand how and why digital technology changes the industrial landscape, companies must understand some of the fundamental characteristics of digital technology and how it demands new types of value creation logic. 

Be it a large corporation or a small start-up; or a government agency or a multinational enterprise; everyone is struggling to deal with the new digital reality. Yet, exactly how to use digital technology to create value is not clear. While all companies must understand how digital technology is fundamentally different from other forms of technology, ironically digital innovation is not about technology. Digital innovation is making digital technology meaningful and value to users. Therefore, digital innovation requires us to truly understand us (people), what we do, why we do what we do, what makes us happy, and what we consider meaningful. Therefore, digital innovation is a deeply humanistic exploration to make digital technology meaningful and valuable to us. 

In order to fully harness the transformative capacity of digital technology, we must gain deeper insights on people and their actions, meanings and values. In this experiential course, we use design as the primary tool to gain such humanistic insights, and work with real-world projects to apply those ideas and tools to build real digital innovations."

CRSP,550,Meta-Analysis & Evidence Synthesis,2 - 3,"Systematic reviews use reproducible methods to systematically search the literature and synthesize the results of a specific topic area. Meta-analysis is a specific analytic technique used to pool results of individual studies. Systematic reviews are useful ways to establish one's knowledge in a particular field of study, and can highlight gaps in research which can be pursued in future work. They can also inform the background of a grant. 

This course is designed to introduce students to the methods of conducting a high quality systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies. We will cover the design, methods, and analytic techniques involved in systematic reviews. These concepts will prepare students to conduct their own systematic review or evaluate the systematic reviews of others. Sessions will be lectures, labs, and presentations.  

Topics include developing a search strategy, abstracting key data, synthesizing the results qualitatively, meta-analytic techniques, grading the quality of studies, grading the strength of the evidence, and manuscript preparation specific to systematic reviews and meta-analysis of intervention studies.  

Caveat:
If you would like to conduct a systematic review of your own that can be published after the course ends, you will need to have several other class members or colleagues willing to work with you on the project. The systematic review should be on a topic where you expect no more than 20-30 included studies in order to be able to complete the review soon after the course ends.

COGS,101,Introduction to Cognitive Science,3,"This course introduces students to the field of cognitive science.  Cognitive scientists are interested in the nature of the human mind--basically, we ask how humans think.  This is a huge question, and has been addressed in one way or another by pretty much every academic field.  Cognitive science tries to unite work from many different fields, including computer science, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, music, art, and literary theory.  In this course, you'll get a basic introduction to some of the topics that are central to human cognition, such as intelligence, categorization, language, and creativity.  We'll ask what can be gained by taking an integrated, cognitive scientific approach to these topics."
COGS,102,Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience,3,"A survey of the fundamental methods, findings, and theories that attempt to understand the human mind from a neuroscientific standpoint.  The course provides the student with background knowledge of brain processes underlying such psychological phenomena as consciousness, sensation, perception, thought, language, and voluntary action.  Since many fields of neuroscience have contributed to cognitive neuroscience, the approach of this course is cross-disciplinary.  It introduces theories and data from clinical and experimental neuropsychology, brain imaging, neuroelectric and neuromagnetic brain activity, the neuroscience of language, and behavioral neuroscience, among other fields."
COGS,201,Human Cognition in Evolution and Development,3,
COGS,202,Cognition and Culture,3,"This course studies the human mind in its natural environment: culture. It covers the fundamental methods, findings, and theories that attempt to understand the growth and evolution of cognition from either a social science or humanistic standpoint. It provides the student with background knowledge of theories of human cultural evolution and change, of the relationship between the cognizing individual and larger social-cognitive structures, and of such phenomena as distributed networks, cooperative mental work, and the phenomenology of human experience. Many disciplines have contributed to this knowledge; hence the approach of this course is cross-disciplinary, including ideas from cultural anthropology, literary studies, art and art history, musicology, philosophy, and the history of technology, among others."
COGS,205,Cognition and Design,3,"Urbanism is design; architecture is design; of course, the aesthetic shaping of artifacts (such as computers, cars, and coffee machines) is design.  Configuring surfaces, volumes, and portions of space in special ways, creating and changing formats for things and places that allow cultural practices to unfold while delimiting them, are essential 'designing"" endeavors of human civilization and are, necessarily, activities based on the cognitive capacities and constraints of our species.  We 'cognize' the human world in terms and frames of 'designed' surroundings.  Design is a basic expressive activity, by which we interact with our artificial and natural surroundings and create 'interfaces' between mind and reality, thus upholding and interpretable world.  Landscapes and cityscapes, work spaces of all sorts, buildings and parks, exteriors and interiors of homes, factories, institutions, and temples; furniture, artifacts such as machines, tools, weapons, symbolic objects, even the configuration ('building') of our own bodies, are design.  An inquiry into cultural cognition, aiming to understand how humans as socio-cultural beings think and feel, therefore needs to explore this dimension of spatial expressivity and to acknowledge it as a constitutive fact of human meaning production; it needs to study the aesthetic and pragmatic, political and historical, philosophical and religious, and simply everyday practical, semiotic aspects of this basic form of human creativity.  This course will focus on spatial expressivity--design--in several primary keys and scales, including design for learning; design for verbal and technical communication, interaction, and commerce; design for expressions of authority and deliberation; and design for emotional display."

COGS,215,Words and Mind,3,"There is something fascinating and special about words. They are the aspect of language that everyone knows about and pays attention to--and every academic discipline with an interest in language has something to say about them! The sheer number of words known by every speaker of any human language is quite vast (and the exact number is a mystery). In this class we will learn about words in all their aspects, and see what the wide weirdness of words can help us understand about the human mind. Subjects covered include the question of what makes a word (is ""ouch"" a word? ""ain't""?); word origins; taboo words; words and memory; word boundaries; and word games, puns, and puzzles."
COGS,272,Morality and Mind,3,"Recent research in cognitive science challenges ethical perspectives founded on the assumption that rationality is key to moral knowledge or that morality is the product of divine revelation.  Bedrock moral concepts like free will, rights, and moral agency also have been questioned.  In light of such critiques, how can we best understand moral philosophy and religious ethics?  Is ethics primarily informed by nature or by culture?  Or is ethics informed by both?  This course examines 1) ways in which cognitive science--and related fields such as evolutionary biology--impact traditional moral perspectives, and 2) how the study of moral philosophy and comparative ethics forces reconsideration of broad cognitive science theories about the nature of ethics.  The course examines the concept of free will as a case study in applying these interpretive viewpoints.  Interdisciplinary readings include literature from moral philosophy, religious ethics, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology.

COGS,305,Social Cognition and the Brain,3,"Human beings develop intricate means of presenting themselves to others; of representing others as friends, enemies, or strangers; of making quick assessments of any situation based on the attribution of intentions; of sizing up the Other via symbols and other shibboleths; and of the disposition and ability to empathize and sympathize with the emotional states of others for specific purposes. In recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. It is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. Such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.
This course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).
By term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience. Each student will articulate a research problem and develop a method for investigating it through independent and collaborative means of practicing their research, critical thinking, writing and communication skills.

COGS,312,Second Language Acquisition I,3,"This course is an introduction to the growing field of second language acquisition (SLA). SLA seeks to understand the linguistic, psychological and social processes that underlie the learning and use of second language(s). The goal of research is to identify the principles and processes that govern second language learning and use. SLA is approached from three perspectives in the course:  1) as linguistic knowledge;2) as a cognitive skill; and 3) as a socially and personality-meditated process. Important factors in second language learning will be identified and discussed. These include: age-related differences, the influence of the first language, the role played by innate (universal) principles, the role of memory processes, attitudes, motivation, personality and cognitive styles, and formal versus naturalistic learning contexts. The objective of this course is to survey the principal research in second language acquisition. Students will become familiar with the major research issues through their reading of both primary and secondary sources, as well as through lectures and class discussions.

COGS,314,Second Language Acquisition II: Second Language Acquisition Research and Second Language Teaching,3,"This course will examine various issues in second language acquisition research that are particularly relevant to foreign language teaching and learning.  Topics covered will include: the role of input (listening/reading) vs. output (speaking/writing); implicit vs. explicit learning; negative vs. positive evidence (including the role of error correction); affective factors (motivation, anxiety); individual differences; teachability hypothesis and syllabus construction, program design/evaluation, language testing, among others.

The purpose of this course is to survey the principal research in the acquisition of second language that is relevant to second language teaching in a classroom setting, and to obtain the state-of-the-art knowledge of the SLA research literature that is relevant to L2 teaching.  The focus is not necessarily on the practical application of the SLA research, although we will not exclude discussion of classroom application.  Rather, we critically examine and evaluate SLA research and come up with our own syntheses with respect to various issues.  To achieve this goal, we should ask following questions in reading and discussing the relevant literature:  1) What are the main claims that the author(s) make(s)?  2) Are the author's claims sound?  If not why?  3) What further research is needed to answer remaining questions?

Students will become familiar with the major research issues through their reading of both primary and secondary sources, as well as through lectures and class discussions.  The students are required to complete a term project that addresses the issues treated in the course.

COGS,331,Introduction to Applied Linguistics,3,"This course provides students with answers to the question, ""Linguistics? What can you do with that?"" We will survey the ways that linguistics has been used (i.e. applied) to solve 'real world' problems. Some of these, like computational linguistics and the teaching of language, are intimately involved in language, even though they do not necessarily concern themselves with linguistic theory. Others, such as language and the law, use linguistics as a tool to do their work. We will be concerned with understanding the various ways that linguistic inquiries have been used or neglected, and also with the implications of applied fields for linguistic theories.

COGS,335,Japanese Linguistics,3,"The purpose of this course is to survey the principal research in Japanese linguistics for students who have basic knowledge of Japanese and are interested in more in-depth treatment of linguistic phenomena (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, etc.). Lectures and discussions will cover many different aspects of the Japanese language. There is a great deal of analytic studies of the Japanese language done both inside and outside Japan, which will be surveyed in this course.  Students will become familiar with the major issues through lectures and class discussions, as well as through their reading of both primary and secondary sources. Both formal and functional approaches to the analysis of Japanese will be examined, and the acquisition of these structures will also be discussed.

COGS,348,Buddhism and Cognitive Science,3,"In 1987, the Dalai Lama initiated a yearly event--Mind and Life Dialogues--to address ""critical issues of modern life at the intersection of scientific and contemplative understanding"". Dialogue topics included issues related to Buddhist thought and practice, and cognitive science. Others with an interest in the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science, such as Robert Wright in Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of Buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. The notion that at least some aspects of Buddhism are ""true"" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both Buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.
This seminar explores Buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. We start with a general overview of Buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on Buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. For instance, we will explore the Buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). This idea resonates with Daniel Dennett's notion of the ""narrative self"" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.
Although the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both Buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.

COGS,352,"Language, Cognition, and Religion",3,"This course utilizes theoretical approaches found in cognitive semantics--a branch of cognitive linguistics--to study the conceptual structures and meanings of religious language.  Cognitive semantics, guided by the notion that conceptual structures are embodied, examines the relationship between conceptual systems and the construction of meaning.  We consider such ideas as conceptual metaphor theory, conceptual blending, Image schemas, cross-domain mappings, metonymy, mental spaces, and idealized cognitive models.  We apply these ideas to selected Christian, Buddhist, and Chinese religious texts in order to understand ways in which religious language categorizes and conceptualizes the world.  We examine both the universality of cognitive linguistic processes and the culturally specific metaphors, conceptual blends, image schemas, and other cognitive operations that particular texts and traditions utilize.

COGS,365,Advanced Topics in Cognitive Neuroscience,3,"This course focuses on specific areas of research in cognitive neuroscience in some depth.  The first half of the semester covers basics and fundamental research areas (e.g., perception, attention) and examines the (sometimes controversial) theoretical issue of what cognitive neuroscience techniques tell us about the mind.  The second half of the semester is dedicated to examining selected research topics of interest to students.  Students research and write 'grant proposals' for cognitive neuroscience experiments.  The class culminates with students and invited faculty simulating a funding panel, and deciding which grants to 'fund' from a limited budget.

Term project required.  Students enrolled in"
COGS,381,Philosophy and Cognitive Neuroscience,3,"This course will focus on the various methodologies used in the cognitive neurosciences, and explore their strengths and weaknesses from scientific and philosophical standpoints. We will begin by examining baseline measures (including IQ tests, tasks of cognitive flexibility, verbal and visual memory, causal/sequential thinking and narrative tasks) and their experimental design. Lesion methods will follow, with an eye toward understanding the strength of inferences that can be drawn from such data. The course will also focus on imaging techniques (CAT, PET, SPECT, fMRI, TMS, etc.) as well as measures of electrical activity such as EEG and single-cell recordings. Students will become familiar with many fundamental assumptions necessary for the implementation of each method, and philosophical questions associated with these endeavors and their potential impact on our knowledge and society.

COGS,390,Introduction to General Semiotics,3,"Semiotics, the study of meaning and signs conveying meaning, is a central part of cognitive semiotics, or 'high level' cognitive semantics.  This discipline is typically taught in departments of linguistics, cognitive science, philosophy, or cultural studies.  The domain of semiotics is in fact widely intersecting with other disciplines (general linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, anthropology, music, literature, architecture, and the arts).  Sign theory, text theory, studies of narrative structure, enunciation, natural logic, rhetoric and poetics, speech act forms, are important components in this field."
COGS,391,Introduction to Text Semiotics,3,"Introduction to Text Semiotics addresses both students of Literature and students in Cognitive Science.  Most of the authors included in the reading list extend their linguistic approach towards fields that intersect literature, psychology, philosophy, aesthetics, and anthropology.  The scholarly traditions of text analysis and structural theory of meaning, including authors from classical formalism, structuralism, structural semiotics, and new criticism will be connected to cognitive theories of meaning construction in test, discourse, and cultural expressions in general.  The focus of this course, taught as a seminar, is on empirical studies, specific text analyses, discourse analyses, speech act analyses, and other studies of speech, writing, and uses of language in cultural contexts.  This course thus introduces to a study of literature and cultural expressions based on cognitive science and modern semiotics--the new view that has be coined Cognitive Semiotics.

COGS,402,Advanced Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience,3,"This course takes an advanced look at how the methods of cognitive neuroscience can be used to inform theories of cognitive function, with implications for a range of disciplines.  Students will be given an overview of methods, brain anatomy, and major findings in the field.  In addition, they will read a number of primary source papers.  The student may expect to come away from the course with a broad acquaintance with modern cognitive neuroscience, how its findings are relevant to a variety of fields, and how to critically assess primary source material.
Cognitive neuroscience is a rapidly evolving field which synthesizes methodologies and conceptual frameworks from numerous different disciplines.  No single individual can hope to master all the methods, background knowledge and conceptual systems which are of key importance to the discipline at any one point in time.  Cognitive Neuroscience is therefore a group activity, in which progress is critically dependent on group interactions both at a local level (the `lab') and at more distributed levels (the wider scientific/academic community).  The key objectives of this introductory course are therefore:
1. To give students a basic overview of current methods in cognitive neuroscience and the current state of knowledge in the field.
2. To enable students to go to, read, understand, research and evaluate the primary literature (i.e. journal articles).
3. To train students in the skills involved in group work, in particular through division of work and integration of acquired knowledge at a local level (i.e. lab-sized group), through effective and clear presentation of work, and through productive interactions with a large community.
The first objective will be accomplished through lectures and assigned textbook readings.  The second goal will be accomplished through assigned journal article readings.  The third goal will be accomplished through a group structured format for accomplishing work, and through `journal club' style presentations to the class."

CLSC,199,Athens: In Search of Socrates,3,"Students selected for their strong background or interest in Greek Civilization spend Spring Break in Athens, Greece (thanks to a collaboration between CWRU's Department of Classics and the Athens Centre).  They follow an intensive seven-day itinerary of travel, visiting major monuments and museums including the Acropolis, Delphi, Epidauros, and Aegina.  Two class sessions of instruction in modern Greek help them to interact with people they meet; but the overwhelming emphasis lies on Classical Athens, the historical-cultural setting for the emergence of Western moral philosophy.  The focus of this mini-course is on the figure of Socrates and the agenda of moral philosophy that the Athenian sage established.  Readings from Plato, Aristophanes, and Aristotle.  Via the Socratic method, students will also study Aristotle's Ethics and test the applicability of that foundational text to their own lives. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."

CLSC,220,"Art & Literature in the Classical Tradition, Pt 1: Renaissance and Baroque (14th to 17th centuries)",3,"Through lectures, varied assignments, and visits to the Cleveland Museum of Art this course will introduce students to the major issues in the study of early modern art and literatures.  The emphasis will inevitably be on Italy, as the place where the physical remains of ancient Rome confronted and inspired such remarkable masters as Michelangelo (as poet and artist), Palladio, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Nicholas Poussin (Bernini and Poussin are represented in the CMAI), though some artists -- notably Leonardo -- resisted the lure of the classical past.  From Italy new ideas spread to the rest of Europe and beyond.  We will not have much time to study Shakespeare in the course, but we will not be able to ignore the greatest author of the Renaissance period.  Like Shakespeare, we will move between the court and the city, between scenes of often-endangered order and scenes of sometimes-productive disorder, in which classical models provided a key cultural and even psychological resource in challenging times. Recommended preparation:"
CLSC,221,Building on Antiquity,3,"Beginning with Ancient Greece and Rome and ending in Cleveland, the course will provide orientation in the architectural orders and in most periods of European and Euro-American architectural history, as well as, to an extent, architectural criticism.  The issue of how architecture has meaning will be central, not least in connection with the formalized ""language"" of classicism and the emergence of development of building types (temple, museum, civic hall, transportation buildings, etc.).  We will also review more subtle ways in which architecture conveys meaning or mood, and the assignment of gendered associations to certain architectural elements.  The course will consider more or less blatant political uses of architecture and architectural imagery, but also more elusive and/or ambiguous cases, as well as the phenomenon of the shifting meanings of architecture through changes of era, owner, audience, etc.  Offered as"
CLSC,222,Classical Tradition 2: Birth of Archaeology,3,"The course will focus on the history of diverse methods for studying societies remote in time and space; i.e., on the formation of the distinct disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, and the interest in the origins of human society and cultural practices.  The birth of archaeology occurred in the context of the profound transformation of European cultural life in the eighteenth century, the era of the Enlightenment.  On the basis of a range of cultural productions (literary and historical texts, objects of luxury and use, etc.), we will study visual and literary works and consider the relationship between different modes of artistic production and expression, as well as the marketing and display of prestigious objects, whether ancient or modern.  We will consider the eighteenth-century model of experiential education, the ""Grand Tour,"" and the formation of private and public collections, as well as the emergence of the museum as institution.  Finally, we will also consider important recent work on the relationship between the production of luxury commodities (sugar, coffee, tea, etc.) through the plantation economy in the Americas and beyond and the development of attitudes and ideas in Europe.

CLSC,224,Sword and Sandal: The Classics in Film,3,"Gladiator.  Alexander.  The 300.  Contemporary society's continuing fascination with putting the ancient world on the big screen is undeniable; and yet the causes underlying this phenomenon are not quite so readily apparent.  In this course we will watch and discuss a number of movies about the ancient world, running the gamut from Hollywood classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus to more recent treatments (the aforementioned 300 and Gladiator, for starters), and from the mainstream and conventional (Clash of the Titans, Disney's Hercules) to the far-out and avant-garde (Fellini's Satyricon, anyone?).  As we do so we'll learn quite a bit about the art and economics of film, on one hand, and the ancient world, on the other.  And yet what we'll keep coming back to are the big questions: what does our fascination with the ancient Mediterranean tell us about ourselves as a society?  Why do such movies get made, and what kinds of agendas do they serve?  To what extent can we recapture the past accurately?  And if we can't, are we doomed to just endlessly projecting our own concerns and desires onto a screen, and dressing them in togas?  No knowledge of ancient languages is required for this course.

CLSC,226,Greek and Roman Sculpture,3,"This survey course explores the history of sculpture in ancient Greece and Rome, from the Mycenaean period through the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337). Students learn how to analyze works of sculpture in terms of form, function, and iconography. Particular emphasis is placed on situating sculptures within the changing historical, cultural, political, and religious contexts of the classical world, including the Greek city-state, the Hellenistic kingdoms that followed Alexander the Great, the Roman Republic, and the Roman Empire. Students will study a variety of sculptures--such as statues, reliefs, and carved gems--from across the Greek and Roman worlds. As we study sculptures from the classical world, we will consider questions of design, patronage, artistic agency, viewer reception, and cultural identity. We will also consider the cultural interaction between ancient Greece and Rome and what impact this had on the production and appearance of sculpture.

Particular emphasis is placed on situating objects and monuments within the changing historical, cultural, political, and religious contexts of ancient Rome, including major changes such as the shift from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire and the advent of Christianity. Students will study a variety of media--such as statues, painting, metalwork, and domestic and public architecture--from the city of Rome itself as well as Roman provinces as far afield as Asia Minor and North Africa. The course will introduce students to famous buildings such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon but also to lesser known but equally important works. As we study major objects and monuments from ancient Rome, we will consider questions of design, patronage, artistic agency, viewer reception, and cultural identity. We will also consider Rome's complex relationship to Greek culture and attempt to answer the question of what makes Roman art distinctively ""Roman.""

The emphasis will be placed on the extraordinary transformations wrought in the city, or at least in key districts, by powerful rulers and/or elites, especially in the ancient empire and in the Renaissance and baroque eras.  In a larger perspective, the great construction projects exerted a far-reaching effect within and beyond Europe, but we will study them in relation to their topographical situation, their functions, and their place in a long history of variations on prestigious themes since many of the artworks and the urban settings featured in the course carry the mark of the Long history of the city itself.

CLSC,319,Greek Tragedy: Plays and Performance in Ancient Athens,3,"This course provides students the opportunity to read a significant number of ancient Greek tragedies in modern English translations. We read, study, and discuss selected works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as selected criticism, ancient and modern, of these plays. All semester we read the plays as literature composed for performance. We study literary elements within the plays and theatrical possibilities inherent in the texts. As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class. The course has three examinations and a final project that includes writing an essay and staging a monologue or scene from one of the tragedies.

CLSC,320,Alexander the Great: Materials and Methods,3,"This course is the Classics Departmental Seminar in the SAGES sequence (normally taken in the Spring semester of a major's Junior year), though it can also be taken for regular credit in Classics or History by both undergraduate and graduate students. The seminar offers students a firm grounding in the discipline of Classics with an emphasis on the diverse materials (particularly primary source material), methods and approaches that can be brought to bear on the study of Greco-Roman antiquity. Students will read and discuss the ancient sources and contemporary scholarship on the enigmatic Alexander the Great drawn from various fields of classics, including history, archaeology, art history, philosophy, gender studies, epigraphy, numismatics, and the reception of Alexander. Based upon this, they will then write a research paper that employs conventions found in the field of Classics. Much of this training, however, will also be transferable to other fields and periods. Because the scope of the seminar moves (along with Alexander himself) beyond Europe and examines the historical foundations of the antagonism between East and West, this course qualifies as a Global and Cultural Diversity course.

CLSC,321,"The Archaeology of Iron Age Italy and Sicily, ca",1000-300,"This course traces the early history and archaeology of the Italian peninsula and Sicily from ca. 1000 BCE to 300 BCE.  During this period, the movement of people brought with a transfer of people, ideas, and culture (both social and material) that would transform the population and landscape of ancient Italy and Sicily. We will look first at Southern Italy and Sicily, where, from about 750 BCE, Greek and Phoenician colonists settled.  We will examine the characteristics of Greek and Phoenician colonies and monuments, as well as the characteristics of the interactions between the new arrivals and the indigenous population, especially the Sikels.  We will then examine how the Villanovan culture was supplanted by the Etruscans in west-central Italy.  Through the close examination of the material culture we will address topics such as status, urbanization, religion and ritual, and the cultures of Italy and Sicily within the wider Mediterranean world.  Finally, we will look at another movement of people and politics: the expansion of Roman hegemony throughout the peninsula.  Numerous theories attempt to explain the effect Roman occupation had on the other populations.  We will analyze critically these theories and look for ourselves on the numerous ways indigenous populations could respond to ""foreign"" occupiers and how the occupiers responded to the indigenes.  We will ""read"" material culture almost like text, guided by concepts such as ""style,"" ""agency"" and ""habitus"" among others.  Through these lenses we will examine the archaeological material from multiple points of view (social, economic, religious, political). In turn, recent theoretical advances that seek to explain the processes of accommodation and emulation of, and resistance to, outside cultural influences will be looked at with a critical eye so that we can come away with fresh ideas about understanding what, and who, culture really is.

CLSC,322,Theater in Ancient Rome,3,This course is designed as a continuation of and companion to CLSC/THTR
CLSC,324,The Sublime and Grotesque in Literature,3,"Early on in Western culture the question of sublime and grotesque was addressed by philosophers and writers. Aristotle and especially Longinus initiated the debate over what exactly made a work of art ""sublim"" or ""Grotesque.""  This debate eventually in the 18th century gave birth to the discipline of aesthetics, which is one of the main foci of this course. To that end, in this course we will examine a few literary works in light of the most representative theories around the concept of sublime and grotesque: Aristotle, Longinus, Kant, Burke, Baumgartner, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Their theories will be applied to some of the most celebrated literary masterpieces written by Homer, Ovid, Dante, Cervantes and others.

CLSC,325,"Art at the Crossroads of Religion: Polytheistic, Christian, and Islamic Art in Antiquity",3,"People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of ""pagan"" and ""Christian"" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine ""Christianized"" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a ""pagan"" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.
Offered as"
CLSC,326,Rome on Site: The Archaeology of the Eternal City,3,"This course offers the opportunity to examine firsthand Roman remains spanning 500 years of the city's history. For three weeks we will explore all sections of Rome and discover how different spheres of Roman life, such as religion, politics, leisure, and death, combined to shape one of the most renowned cityscapes of the ancient Mediterranean world. The course constitutes a mix of museum and site visits to expose us to the artifacts that help us interpret the Roman world, including art and other types of material culture, and the monumental architecture dominating much of Rome to this day. We will also explore important sites outside of the city, including Rome's remarkably well-preserved port at Ostia, the Emperor Hadrian's magnificent villa at Tivoli, and an optional visit to Pompeii and Herculaneum during an extended weekend.
Some of the questions we will be asking when visiting the sites include: How did the expansion of the Roman Empire influence the stylistic repertories of the capital's artists and architects? How did the changing political environment shape the topography of the city from Republic to Empire? How can we read political messages and propaganda in the ancient structures? How did (and does) Rome live among, use, and reuse ancient remains?
Students will be expected to be active participants in the daily tours. All students will be presenting on various structures as we come to them (topics to be assigned in advance of the trip). Graduate students are responsible for leading a day tour (with my assistance) - to create the itinerary and develop the thematic framework. Grades will be based on participation on site, presentations, and a paper.

CLSC,327,"The Parthenon Then and Now: New Discoveries, Old Problems and Reception",3,"The Parthenon is an icon of western art and culture. Over 250 year of scholarship on this  world-renowned building have revealed many of its secrets, but  numerous questions still remain.  New finds on the Acropolis itself and elsewhere in Greece have shed light on some of these issues, and as a result new theories abound.  This seminar offers an overview of the temple,  its architecture and sculpture, and will investigate its place in the civic and religious ideology of classical Athens.  The course will also trace the Parthenon's many post-classical permutations, into a Christian Church and an Islamic mosque, and its impact on later western art and architecture.  Finally the class will debate the moral and ethical issue of the Elgin Marbles - to repatriate them to Greece or to retain them in the British Museum in perpetuity.

CLSC,329,Marvels of Rome: Monuments and Their Decoration in the Roman Empire,3,"This course examines some of the most famous monuments of the Roman Empire, including Nero's Golden House, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, and the lavish villa of Piazza Armerina in Sicily. We will study each monument in depth, delving into the architecture, paintings, sculptures, mosaics, and social functions of each monument. Students will learn how to analyze artistic and archaeological evidence, ancient textual evidence (poems, prose, and inscriptions), and secondary scholarship to reconstruct the visual appearances and historical and cultural contexts of the monuments in questions. Throughout the course, students will gain a new appreciation and deeper understanding of some of the most iconic buildings of the classical tradition.

CLSC,331,Dante and the Classical Tradition: Middle Ages into Modernity,3,"""Dante and the Classical Tradition"" will introduce through the complex work of Dante the concept of classical tradition as an all-encompassing cultural term. Dante represents the grandiose example of the artist who seeks the complete synthesis between humanities and sciences and their incessant collaborative effort to broaden as much as possible the depths of human knowledge. Philosophy, Geography, Physics, Linguistics, Astronomy and Literature are steady landmarks in Dante's work through which he aims to speak about the necessity of ever maintaining continuity between all domains of human knowledge. Dante's work proposes high levels of excellence and while the course's focus will be on his literary output the scientific interests and treatises he demonstrates will not be omitted during class discussion and bibliography included in the syllabus. Last but not least the focus will be on how we understand today the concept of classical tradition as a result of Dante's writings.

CLSC,336,Representations of War in Ancient Rome,3,"Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be Roman"" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.

CLSC,381,Classics Senior Capstone,3,"The capstone is the final requirement of the SAGES program and is normally taken in the fall semester of senior year.  It involves an independent study paper resulting from exploration of a topic chosen in consultation with the student's capstone advisor, who will regularly review progress on the project.  In the capstone students employ, integrate, and demonstrate analytical, rhetorical, and practical skills developed and honed through the SAGES curriculum as well as their major or minor studies.  The Capstone Project has both a written and an oral component: oral presentation and argumentation will be stressed.  The product of the capstone may take different forms: there will always be a written component, but other forms of expression are also encouraged, such as a webpage or poster for a poster session.

CLSC,427,"The Parthenon Then and Now: New Discoveries, Old Problems and Reception",3,"The Parthenon is an icon of western art and culture. Over 250 year of scholarship on this  world-renowned building have revealed many of its secrets, but  numerous questions still remain.  New finds on the Acropolis itself and elsewhere in Greece have shed light on some of these issues, and as a result new theories abound.  This seminar offers an overview of the temple,  its architecture and sculpture, and will investigate its place in the civic and religious ideology of classical Athens.  The course will also trace the Parthenon's many post-classical permutations, into a Christian Church and an Islamic mosque, and its impact on later western art and architecture.  Finally the class will debate the moral and ethical issue of the Elgin Marbles - to repatriate them to Greece or to retain them in the British Museum in perpetuity.

CLSC,431,Dante and the Classical Tradition: Middle Ages into Modernity,3,"""Dante and the Classical Tradition"" will introduce through the complex work of Dante the concept of classical tradition as an all-encompassing cultural term. Dante represents the grandiose example of the artist who seeks the complete synthesis between humanities and sciences and their incessant collaborative effort to broaden as much as possible the depths of human knowledge. Philosophy, Geography, Physics, Linguistics, Astronomy and Literature are steady landmarks in Dante's work through which he aims to speak about the necessity of ever maintaining continuity between all domains of human knowledge. Dante's work proposes high levels of excellence and while the course's focus will be on his literary output the scientific interests and treatises he demonstrates will not be omitted during class discussion and bibliography included in the syllabus. Last but not least the focus will be on how we understand today the concept of classical tradition as a result of Dante's writings.

CLSC,436,Representations of War in Ancient Rome,3,"Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be Roman"" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.

BIOL,314,Taming the Tree of Life: Phylogenetic Comparative Methods-from Concept to Practical Application,3,"""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution""  --  Dobzhansky
Biologists have long been fascinated by the diversity of life. Why are there so many species? Why are some of them similar and others divergent? How has evolution shaped ecological interactions, such as disease-host dynamics? The ""tree of life"" describes phylogenetic hypotheses for evolutionary history among species, and modern phylogenetic comparative methods allow us to incorporate the tree of life into statistical analyses. This course will introduce phylogenetic comparative methods, why they are needed to answer many biological questions, how they are conducted, and how they can be used to evaluate hypotheses. These methods can be used for any group of organisms, from humans and their diseases, to plants, animals, or fungi. These methods also can be used to address a broad suite of questions in biology, including biomedical, ecological, evolutionary, developmental, and neuromechanical questions. For example, issues of public health can be more deeply addressed using these tools. Students may bring their own data sets, or may use existing data sets, and will develop an independent research project using these tools.

BIOL,414,Taming the Tree of Life: Phylogenetic Comparative Methods-from Concept to Practical Application,3,"""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution""  --  Dobzhansky
Biologists have long been fascinated by the diversity of life. Why are there so many species? Why are some of them similar and others divergent? How has evolution shaped ecological interactions, such as disease-host dynamics? The ""tree of life"" describes phylogenetic hypotheses for evolutionary history among species, and modern phylogenetic comparative methods allow us to incorporate the tree of life into statistical analyses. This course will introduce phylogenetic comparative methods, why they are needed to answer many biological questions, how they are conducted, and how they can be used to evaluate hypotheses. These methods can be used for any group of organisms, from humans and their diseases, to plants, animals, or fungi. These methods also can be used to address a broad suite of questions in biology, including biomedical, ecological, evolutionary, developmental, and neuromechanical questions. For example, issues of public health can be more deeply addressed using these tools. Students may bring their own data sets, or may use existing data sets, and will develop an independent research project using these tools.

ARTH,311,Rome: City and Image,3,"This course studies the architectural and urban history of Rome from the republican era of the ancient city up to the eighteenth century using the city itself as the major ""text.""  The emphasis will be placed on the extraordinary transformations wrought in the city, or at least in key districts, by powerful rulers and/or elites, especially in the ancient empire and in the Renaissance and baroque eras.  In a larger perspective, the great construction projects exerted a far-reaching effect within and beyond Europe, but we will study them in relation to their topographical situation, their functions, and their place in a long history of variations on prestigious themes since many of the artworks and the urban settings featured in the course carry the mark of the Long history of the city itself.

ARTH,325,"Art at the Crossroads of Religion: Polytheistic, Christian, and Islamic Art in Antiquity",3,"People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of ""pagan"" and ""Christian"" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine ""Christianized"" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a ""pagan"" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.

ARTH,327,"The Parthenon Then and Now: New Discoveries, Old Problems and Reception",3,"The Parthenon is an icon of western art and culture. Over 250 year of scholarship on this  world-renowned building have revealed many of its secrets, but  numerous questions still remain.  New finds on the Acropolis itself and elsewhere in Greece have shed light on some of these issues, and as a result new theories abound.  This seminar offers an overview of the temple,  its architecture and sculpture, and will investigate its place in the civic and religious ideology of classical Athens.  The course will also trace the Parthenon's many post-classical permutations, into a Christian Church and an Islamic mosque, and its impact on later western art and architecture.  Finally the class will debate the moral and ethical issue of the Elgin Marbles - to repatriate them to Greece or to retain them in the British Museum in perpetuity.

We will study each monument in depth, delving into the architecture, paintings, sculptures, mosaics, and social functions of each monument. Students will learn how to analyze artistic and archaeological evidence, ancient textual evidence (poems, prose, and inscriptions), and secondary scholarship to reconstruct the visual appearances and historical and cultural contexts of the monuments in questions.

ARTH,336,Representations of War in Ancient Rome,3,"Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be Roman"" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.

We will explore the imagery and texts of monastic and courtly manuscripts, travel books and devotional manuals, all within the framework of the tightly interwoven theological and social discourses of the institutions that commissioned them. As the title of the course indicates, we will study Christian, Jewish, and Islamic books and their interrelations; for example, we will compare Islamic encyclopedias of the natural world, such as Zakariya ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini's illustrated Wonders of Creation, with medieval bestiaries, herbals, and encyclopedias such as Hartman Schedel's Liber Chronicarum and Les Merveilles du Monde.

ARTH,356,"Medieval Matters: The Monstrous, the Macabre, the Miraculous",3,"This course will explore three distinct but interrelated topics in medieval visual culture, which haunt the modern world as well. We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once. Students should be prepared to discuss these topics both within the context of medieval Europe and within our own historical moment.

Each week one or two monuments will be discussed in depth, and other sites will be introduced to place it into historical and art historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are the power relationships between sovereignty and religion; visual expressions of politics and propaganda; the ways literature, performance, and devotion informed medieval material culture; the importance of pilgrimage; and influences of international trade. Ethical and nationalist issues surrounding looting and cultural patrimony will also be discussed. Objects from CMA's permanent collections will form an integral part of the course.

ARTH,359,Visual Culture of Medieval Women,3,"This course will consider the roles of women as patrons, subjects, producers and consumers of visual culture, focusing particularly on the twelfth through fifteenth centuries. Throughout the course, we will study the different ways medieval men and women perceived, read, figured, and interacted with the female body, which was frequently seen as a fraught site of desire and repulsion, fear and fascination. Students will be asked to read primary sources as well as critical materials that address contradictory constructions of gender and sex in medieval images and texts. The course, therefore, will not simply focus on artistic production, but will include readings and discussions of social and political history, theology, and literature of the Middle Ages.

We will also analyze the changing social, cultural, religious, and political circumstances of the art made during this period, which saw the invention of printmaking, the Protestant Revolution, and increased strife between rulers and their subjects.  The rise of new subjects such as landscape and scene of everyday life will be explored, and changes in patronage will be discussed, concentrating on the shift from church and noble patronage to increasingly middle-class patronage related to the beginnings of the open art market.

ARTH,368,Doors Wide Shut: The Private Art Collection from Raphael to Rauschenberg,3,"A child's room is often stocked with marvels: bird nests, shells, shiny stones, books, and drawings. The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting in
the western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.

ARTH,382,"Art, Eco-criticism, and the Environment",3,"As issues of sustainability and environmental impact have become increasingly dominant concerns in contemporary society, eco-criticism has emerged as a vital methodological thread across the humanities.  Motivated by ethical as well as scholarly concerns, eco-criticism not only enacts a fundamental examination of nature as an ideological construct, but also seeks to investigate the complex interrelationship between humanity and the environment.  Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of ""green issues"" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.

ARTH,384,American Art and Architecture in the Age of Washington and Jefferson,3,"In the 18th century, Americans created not only a political revolution but an artistic and creative one as well.  In the 17th century, most Americans were subsistence farmers and most of their products, manufactures, and buildings were relatively crude.  In the 18th century, Americans not only established a new and lasting form of government, but for the first time produced paintings, buildings, furniture and silver that rivaled the finest productions of Europe. Notably, many of the leaders of the American Revolution, such as Paul Revere, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson, also made significant contributions to the arts.

ARTH,390,The Work of Art and the Museum,3,"This writing-intensive class will explore essential questions about the art museum, art collecting, authenticity, and quality through analysis of the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art.  The CMA is generally regarded as one of the top ten American art museums, and one of the few that provides a near-comprehensive survey of art from all regions of the world from ancient times to the present. 

In order to exist, any art museum must provide practical answers to large questions.  What is a work of art?  What is a masterpiece?  What sorts of meanings do works of art communicate?  What sort of history do works of art provide?  How does the context in which an artwork is placed affect its meaning?  What should an art museum collect and what should it exclude?  We will explore these issues through close readings of texts, discussions, and meetings with art historians and curators, and above all through first-hand study of and contact with original works of art. Counts as SAGES Departmental Seminar."

ARTH,397,Contemporary Art in East Asia,3,"This course will explore modern and contemporary art and visual culture in East Asia produced since the mid-twentieth century with a focus on major artistic movements and artists active in China, Japan, and Korea. Encountering complicated geopolitical and socioeconomic conditions in the post-war era, a series of experimental and radical artistic, cultural, and political movements have emerged in East Asia. The course will map the critical topographies of Asian art from 1945 to the 1980s through the exploration of the following: post-war art and experimental art in Japan and Korea, Chinese art during the Cultural Revolution, material culture in Japanese Mono-ha and Korean Dansaekhwa, and art of resistance in China and Korea in the 1980s. The course will also investigate contemporary Asian art and visual culture focusing on its global turn from the late 1980s. Fueled by international geopolitical change, economic boom, and the impact of globalization, art in Asia or by Asian artists has gained a high level of international visibility and taken a central position in contemporary art exhibitions and art criticism. This visual, social, and theoretical development in the recent art in Asia will be examined through key issues and themes: art's revisiting of tradition and history, its exploration of body and identity, the impact of consumerism and popular culture, and its engagement with public space and the urban environment.

ARTH,401,Museums and Globalization,3,"Museums are everywhere contested spaces today.  Historically designed as symbols of power, centers for research, agents of public education and community formation in Western industrial societies, they have become sites of development and cultural controversy on a global scale.  From Cleveland and Paris to Nairobi and Dubai museums figure in urban redevelopment, national identity formation, conflicts between religion and science, and global tourism.  Questions we will consider in this course: what are the fundamental features of museums as institutions? what ties have linked them to wider national and international communities of academics, NGO's and business? to political, economic and social concerns? how do museums in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America figure in the current international contention over heritage rights?  This is an innovative course allowing students to collaborate on projects, engage with guest lecturers and access museums across the globe.  The course is organized in three parts: Part I: National Identity Building and Museums; Part II: Museums and Identity Politics; Part III: Museums and Global Development.

ARTH,402,Buddhist Art in Asia,3,"This course explores the visual and material culture of Buddhism in Asia from its origins in India to its transmission and transformation in China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia.  Our historically and culturally structured examination traces major developments in Buddhist art and their relationships with belief, practice, and ritual.  We consider the ways that artistic traditions have adapted and evolved both within individual cultures and cross-culturally. We primarily focus on studying the historical contexts for sculpture, architecture, and painting, but we also consider the movement of Buddhist works from temples to sites of secular display in museums around the world, and the religious, cultural, and ethical issues that arise from these moves.  Topics include:  representations of the life of the historical Buddha; visual programs of temples; artistic representations of paradises and hells; sacred sites and architecture; imperial patronage of Buddhist art; the role of art in pilgrimage and ritual; and visual imagery associated with Pure Land, Chan, Zen and esoteric traditions.  Visits to and engagement with objects in the new Asian galleries at the Cleveland Museum of Art provide a rich environment for our class sessions and student projects.

ARTH,407,Arts of China,3,"This course explores a selection of major developments in Chinese visual and material culture from ancient times to the present day.  We consider works in multiple media including bronzes, pottery, sculpture, calligraphy, paintings, ceramics and installations. We look into the roles of art in society, the relationship of art to political authority, the place of art in religious practice and experience, connections between art and literature, and how art relates to the expression of personal, social, political, and cultural identity. We pay particular attention to landscape painting; pictorial and sculptural programs of Buddhist grottoes; art commissioned and collected by the imperial court; objects associated with Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian religious practices and sacred sites; art produced during periods of non-Chinese rule under the Mongols and Manchus; the affects of foreign styles and ideas on artists; and the role of Chinese artists in the contemporary global art world and market. We also examine the role of museums in selecting, preserving, and presenting Chinese art in the 20th and 21st century. Visits to the Cleveland Museum of Art form an integral part of the course.

ARTH,408,"Daoism: Visual Culture, History and Practice",3,"This course explores developments in the visual culture, history and practices of Daoist religious traditions in China from the third to twentieth centuries. Our historically and conceptually structured examination draws upon a balance of visual, textual, and material sources, while considering the various approaches scholars have employed to understand the history and development of Daoist traditions. Topics include: sacred scriptures and liturgies, biographies and visual narratives, iconography and functions of the pantheon of gods and immortals, views of the self and the body, practices of inner alchemy and self-cultivation, thunder deities and exorcism, dietetics and medicine and modes of meditation and ritual.

ARTH,411,Rome: City and Image,3,"This course studies the architectural and urban history of Rome from the republican era of the ancient city up to the eighteenth century using the city itself as the major ""text.""  The emphasis will be placed on the extraordinary transformations wrought in the city, or at least in key districts, by powerful rulers and/or elites, especially in the ancient empire and in the Renaissance and baroque eras.  In a larger perspective, the great construction projects exerted a far-reaching effect within and beyond Europe, but we will study them in relation to their topographical situation, their functions, and their place in a long history of variations on prestigious themes since many of the artworks and the urban settings featured in the course carry the mark of the Long history of the city itself.  Recommended preparation: At least one 200-level course in ANTH, ARTH, CLSC, ENGL, HSTY, or RLGN.

ARTH,425,"Art at the Crossroads of Religion: Polytheistic, Christian, and Islamic Art in Antiquity",3,"People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of ""pagan"" and ""Christian"" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine ""Christianized"" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a ""pagan"" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.

ARTH,427,"The Parthenon Then and Now: New Discoveries, Old Problems and Reception",3,"The Parthenon is an icon of western art and culture. Over 250 year of scholarship on this  world-renowned building have revealed many of its secrets, but  numerous questions still remain.  New finds on the Acropolis itself and elsewhere in Greece have shed light on some of these issues, and as a result new theories abound.  This seminar offers an overview of the temple,  its architecture and sculpture, and will investigate its place in the civic and religious ideology of classical Athens.  The course will also trace the Parthenon's many post-classical permutations, into a Christian Church and an Islamic mosque, and its impact on later western art and architecture.  Finally the class will debate the moral and ethical issue of the Elgin Marbles - to repatriate them to Greece or to retain them in the British Museum in perpetuity.

ARTH,429,Marvels of Rome: Monuments and Their Decoration in the Roman Empire,3,"This course examines some of the most famous monuments of the Roman Empire, including Nero's Golden House, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, and the lavish villa of Piazza Armerina in Sicily. We will study each monument in depth, delving into the architecture, paintings, sculptures, mosaics, and social functions of each monument. Students will learn how to analyze artistic and archaeological evidence, ancient textual evidence (poems, prose, and inscriptions), and secondary scholarship to reconstruct the visual appearances and historical and cultural contexts of the monuments in questions. Throughout the course, students will gain a new appreciation and deeper understanding of some of the most iconic buildings of the classical tradition.

ARTH,436,Representations of War in Ancient Rome,3,"Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be Roman"" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.

We will consider a variety of media, including architecture, metalwork, sculpture, manuscript illumination, panel paintings, fresco cycles, and small devotional objects.  As we study medieval art in its socio-historical contexts--private and public, monastic and political, liturgical and lay--we will pay special attention to issues of patronage, relationships between texts and images, the introduction of visionary and mystical devotion, attitudes towards education and authority, differences between male and female piety, modes of medieval viewing, and reception and manipulation of art by medieval audiences.

We will explore the imagery and texts of monastic and courtly manuscripts, travel books and devotional manuals, all within the framework of the tightly interwoven theological and social discourses of the institutions that commissioned them. As the title of the course indicates, we will study Christian, Jewish, and Islamic books and their interrelations; for example, we will compare Islamic encyclopedias of the natural world, such as Zakariya ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini's illustrated Wonders of Creation, with medieval bestiaries, herbals, and encyclopedias such as Hartman Schedel's Liber Chronicarum and Les Merveilles du Monde. Each religious culture will receive a special close-study spotlight: Jewish Haggadot (books for the Passover Seder), Christian courtly romances, and Islamic manuscripts of the Shahnama epic.

ARTH,456,"Medieval Matters: The Monstrous, the Macabre, the Miraculous",3,"This course will explore three distinct but interrelated topics in medieval visual culture, which haunt the modern world as well. We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once. Students should be prepared to discuss these topics both within the context of medieval Europe and within our own historical moment.
Offered as"
ARTH,457,Medieval Wonders: Monuments from Across the Globe,3,"This course will introduce art of the medieval world, considered globally, with a special focus on monuments surviving from the seventh to fifteenth centuries. Emphasis will be on sculpture and architecture; other media--manuscript illumination, wall paintings, ceramics, and metalwork--will be discussed in conjunction with the related sites. We will travel, virtually, to Pre-Columbian Yucatan, Judeo-Christian Europe, Islamic Spain and Central Asia, Hindu and Buddhist India, Tibet, and Southeast Asia. Each week one or two monuments will be discussed in depth, and other sites will be introduced to place it into historical and art historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are the power relationships between sovereignty and religion; visual expressions of politics and propaganda; the ways literature, performance, and devotion informed medieval material culture; the importance of pilgrimage; and influences of international trade. Ethical and nationalist issues surrounding looting and cultural patrimony will also be discussed. Objects from CMA's permanent collections will form an integral part of the course. Each unit will end with the consideration of collecting practices.
Offered as"
ARTH,458,Medieval Body,3,"This course will explore the meanings and representations of the body in western medieval culture.  Topics will include bleeding bodies, fragmented bodies, lactating bodies, labile bodies, cosmic bodies, physiological bodies, mystical bodies, suffering bodies, edible bodies, enclosed bodies, gendered bodies, Christ's bodies, Mary's bodies, decomposing bodies, macabre bodies, resurrected bodies, dead bodies, intercessory bodies, unhinging bodies, translucent bodies, martyred bodies, desirable bodies, desirous bodies, abhorrent bodies, mimetic bodies, nude bodies, marginalized bodies, defleshed bodies, social bodies, political bodies, monstrous bodies, mnemonic bodies, and deformed bodies.  We will explore the complex rhetoric of embodiment as it manifests itself in the ambiguous discourse--both medieval and contemporary--on the relationships between the material and intangible, spiritual and physical, somatic and mental, corporeal and ethereal.
Offered as"
ARTH,459,Visual Culture of Medieval Women,3,"This course will consider the roles of women as patrons, subjects, producers and consumers of visual culture, focusing particularly on the twelfth through fifteenth centuries. Throughout the course, we will study the different ways medieval men and women perceived, read, figured, and interacted with the female body, which was frequently seen as a fraught site of desire and repulsion, fear and fascination. Students will be asked to read primary sources as well as critical materials that address contradictory constructions of gender and sex in medieval images and texts. The course, therefore, will not simply focus on artistic production, but will include readings and discussions of social and political history, theology, and literature of the Middle Ages.

We will also analyze the changing social, cultural, religious, and political circumstances of the art made during this period, which saw the invention of printmaking, the Protestant Revolution, and increased strife between rulers and their subjects.  The rise of new subjects such as landscape and scene of everyday life will be explored, and changes in patronage will be discussed, concentrating on the shift from church and noble patronage to increasingly middle-class patronage related to the beginnings of the open art market.

ARTH,468,Doors Wide Shut: The Private Art Collection from Raphael to Rauschenberg,3,"A child's room is often stocked with marvels: bird nests, shells, shiny stones, books, and drawings. The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting in
the western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.

ARTH,496,"Materials, Methods, and Physical Examination of Works of Art",3,"This foundational course will introduce students to the examination methods, terminology and goals of art conservation as it supports art historical research and practice. Students will learn about the various materials that make up different kinds of works of art, how these materials have been used, and what can be learned by the physical examination of works of art. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the uses of and results obtained with imaging techniques (such as X-radiography, infrared reflectography) and on what can be learned through the trained use of the human eye alone. While art from the western tradition, particularly from the 14th through the 21st centuries will be emphasized in class examples, comparisons will be made to objects from other global cultures. The growing field of technical art history, where the results of physical examination are used to illuminate art historical issues such as how workshops functioned, will be considered as well. Each student will research one work of art in the Cleveland Museum of Art or other local collections to understand the physical history and current condition of that object. The goal will be for students to gain an informed understanding of how to evaluate the condition of a work of art, of what options are available for conservation treatment, and of what art-historical information can be obtained through physical examination."
ARTH,497,Contemporary Art in East Asia,3,"This course will explore modern and contemporary art and visual culture in East Asia produced since the mid-twentieth century with a focus on major artistic movements and artists active in China, Japan, and Korea. Encountering complicated geopolitical and socioeconomic conditions in the post-war era, a series of experimental and radical artistic, cultural, and political movements have emerged in East Asia. The course will map the critical topographies of Asian art from 1945 to the 1980s through the exploration of the following: post-war art and experimental art in Japan and Korea, Chinese art during the Cultural Revolution, material culture in Japanese Mono-ha and Korean Dansaekhwa, and art of resistance in China and Korea in the 1980s. The course will also investigate contemporary Asian art and visual culture focusing on its global turn from the late 1980s. Fueled by international geopolitical change, economic boom, and the impact of globalization, art in Asia or by Asian artists has gained a high level of international visibility and taken a central position in contemporary art exhibitions and art criticism. This visual, social, and theoretical development in the recent art in Asia will be examined through key issues and themes: art's revisiting of tradition and history, its exploration of body and identity, the impact of consumerism and popular culture, and its engagement with public space and the urban environment.

ARTH,498,History and Practice of Connoisseurship,3,"In this seminar we will consider the history, historiography , and practice of connoisseurship.  In western cultures connoisseurship, the practice of attributing works of art to specific artists, regions, and time periods and assessing their quality, can be traced back to classical antiquity.  It was practiced with renewed vigor in Europe from the sixteenth century onward and in the nineteenth century was a foundational methodology for the academic discipline of art history.  While it came under criticism in the twentieth century as a method too closely aligned with the art market, connoisseurship continues to be practiced today, especially in museums and auction houses, as a vital and necessary methodological approach.  In recent decades art historians have also begun to reevaluate the history, practices and historiographic importance of this methodology.  Class discussions of the scholarly literature of connoisseurship and case studies of its practice will alternate with sessions held in the Cleveland Museum of Art to examine objects from the permanent collections.  The museum sessions, led by curators and conservators, will also emphasize the role that physical condition plays in making connoisseurship assessments.  Specific topics will be designated each time the course is offered.

ANTH,325,Economic Anthropology,3,"Economic anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology that examines how people in modern and non-modern societies produce, distribute, exchange, and consume goods, services, and other valued resources. The sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. However, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.

This course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. The history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. This class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common.

ANTH,339,Ethnographic and Qualitative Research Methods,3,"This is a course on applying ethnographic research methods in the social sciences.  Ethnographic research seeks to understand and describe the experiences of research participants (i.e. subjects) through becoming involved in their daily lives.  Findings from ethnography are generated through systematic observation within the natural context in which behavior occurs (i.e. fieldwork).  Unlike methods that emphasize detachment, distance, and objectivity, ethnography involves developing knowledge by becoming an ad hoc member of the group(s) one is studying.  The principal techniques of ethnography, ""participant-observation"" and ""In-depth open ended interviewing,"" require actively engaging the research process.  This class will explore ethnographic research techniques, as well as other qualitative research methods.

ANTH,370,Field Seminar in Paleoanthropology,12,"Paleoanthropology is the study of human physical and cultural evolution based on fossils and cultural remains from ancient geological times. These fossils and cultural remains are collected by conducting fieldwork in various parts of the world where geological phenomena have exposed fossiliferous sedimentary windows from the deep past. Hence, fieldwork is one of the major backbones of paleoanthropology. This course is designed for advanced undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing higher degrees in paleoanthropology, human paleobiology, evolutionary biology, or other related disciplines. This course introduces students to the principles and methods of  paleontological fieldwork in real time. It introduces students to paleoanthropological fieldwork from locating fossiliferous areas based on aerial photo interpretations to survey methodology; from methods of systematic excavation, fossil collection and documentation in the field, to curation and preparation of fossil specimens in laboratories; from conducting scientific analyses in laboratory environments to subsequently publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals.

ANTH,382,Anthropological and Ecological Perspectives on Preserving and Restoring the Natural World,3,"Now that the environmentally deleterious effects of modern Western culture on the natural world have reached major proportions it has become crucial to explore innovative solutions to this dilemma.  In this course novel perspectives derived from the intersection of anthropology and ecology are discussed.  The primary perspective focused upon is the understanding that human culture and the natural world in which it is embedded are essentially communicative, or semiotic processes, which thrive upon diverse interaction and feedback.  Preserving and restoring the Natural World thus shifts from protecting individual species and particular cultural practices to enhancing the communicative matrix of life and multiple cultural views of the environment.  Through this understanding, students will learn to apply a more elegant, effective, and aesthetically pleasing perspective to the challenging environmental issues facing our contemporary world.  An in-depth examination of the North American Prairie, along with a comparison of influences on the landscape by indigenous and modern Western Culture will serve as the particular region of focus.

ANTH,425,Economic Anthropology,3,"Economic anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology that examines how people in modern and non-modern societies produce, distribute, exchange, and consume goods, services, and other valued resources. The sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. However, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.

This course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. The history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. This class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common. On this backdrop, this class will survey a number of different topics, including: health commodification; gift exchange; commodity chains; the history of money and debt; why objects have value; how people make ends meet; rational vs. non-rational decision-making; behavioral economic experiments conducted in other cultures; development economics, and why some objects and services have prices while others do not.

ANTH,439,Ethnographic and Qualitative Research Methods,3,"This is a course on applying ethnographic research methods in the social sciences.  Ethnographic research seeks to understand and describe the experiences of research participants (i.e. subjects) through becoming involved in their daily lives.  Findings from ethnography are generated through systematic observation within the natural context in which behavior occurs (i.e. fieldwork).  Unlike methods that emphasize detachment, distance, and objectivity, ethnography involves developing knowledge by becoming an ad hoc member of the group(s) one is studying.  The principal techniques of ethnography, ""participant-observation"" and ""In-depth open ended interviewing,"" require actively engaging the research process.  This class will explore ethnographic research techniques, as well as other qualitative research methods.  In addition to addressing how such methods make claims about social phenomena, this class will also explore more practical topics such as: developing questions, entering the field, establishing rapport, taking and managing field notes, coding data, and data analysis.

ANTH,447,Cultural Ecology: An Epistemological Approach to Environmental Sustainability,3,"This course provides the understanding that the realm of human culture is where both the cause and cure of nearly all contemporary environmental sustainability challenges are found.  This is because culture is the medium through which humans as living systems perceive, interpret, and act upon their environment.  Through understanding principles that guide living systems and applying them to human/nature interaction in diverse cultures throughout the world, students develop an ecological epistemology, or way of knowing nature.  This leads to more effective advocacy for environmental sustainability and an increasing depth in interaction with nature, particularly in the domains of aesthetics and the sacred.
