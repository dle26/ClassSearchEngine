emba,445,expanding boundaries,2,"this course will help you understand the keys to successful corporate development-competitive advantage in every business in which a firm is involved.  in particular, the course will help the participants to understand the following:
-corporate development strategy through capabilities and leveragable capabilities
-before venturing into a new business, the firm has to have a clear understanding of the critical capabilities required for success in the new business.
-firms can increase the odds of success if they can leverage  (parts of ) existing capabilities to new businesses.
-corporate development strategies-adapting to a market
-analyze the industry environment in order to select the competitive battlefield to increase the odds of success by leveraging some of your existing capabilities - sometimes also known as core competencies.  this is a relatively low risk strategy.  we will develop methodologies that will allow you to identify markets (segments) where your current capabilities are leveragable.
-shaping a market usually requires developing a completely new set of capabilities - very risky.  we will develop concepts to understand techniques to mitigate these risks.
-acquisitions as one of the means for corporate development
-approximately half of the class sessions will be devoted to the specific case of acquisitions as a means to expand the boundaries of a firm.  we will explore both how acquisitions contribute to competitive advantage and the selection process and integration of the acquired entity.  less emphasis will be placed on strict financial valuations and negotiations.

emba,446,managing risk and real options,2,"the course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  in the finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  you studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, npv, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  the first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  the course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  we look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  the second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. in competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  as soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, dcf, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  a better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed.

emba,450,managerial marketing,2,"this course is designed with three overarching objectives. the first is an emphasis on decision making in a broad range of market contexts. the second objective builds on the notion that decision making is dynamic; that is, market situations demand not just one good decision but a series of them as a situation unfolds (providing new and varied information for each subsequent decision). integrating concepts from a number of the courses that you are taking concurrently into decision-making about markets is a final objective.
prereq: e.m.b.a. candidates only."
emba,451,business model design,2,"in most companies the process of designing business models is an ad hoc process and in my opinion an inefficient process.  in this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  we will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  the first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  the second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  this seems easy because everything is in english and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  however, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.

you will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.  after the completion of this course you should be quickly able to draw the outline of a business model for any business opportunity that you're considering.

emse,468,scientific writing in materials science and engineering,3,"for writing a thesis (or a publication) in the field of materials science and engineering, students need a diverse set of skills in addition to mastering the scientific content. generally, scientific writing requires proficiency in document organization, professional presentation of numerical and graphical data, literature retrieval and management, text processing, version control, graphical illustration, mathematical typesetting, the english language, elements of style, etc. scientific writing in materials science and engineering, specifically, requires additional knowledge about e.g. conventions of numerical precision, error limits, mathematical typesetting, proper use of units, proper digital processing of micrographs, etc. having to acquire these essential skills at the beginning of thesis (or publication) writing may compromise the outcome by distracting from the most important task of composing the best possible scientific content.
this course properly prepares students for scientific writing with a comprehensive spectrum of knowledge, skills, and tools enabling them to fully focus on the scientific content of their thesis or publication when the time has come to start writing. similar to artistic drawing, where the ability to ""see"" is as (or more!) important as skills of the hand, the ability of proper scientific writing is intimately linked to the ability of critically reviewing scientific texts. therefore, students will practice both authoring and critical reviewing of material science texts. to sharpen students' skills of reviewing, examples of good and less good scientific writing will be taken from published literature of materials science and engineering and analyzed in the context of knowledge acquired in the course. at the end of the course, students will have set up skills and a highly functional work environment to start writing their role thesis or article with full focus on the scientific content. while the course mainly targets students of materials science and engineering, students of other disciplines of science and engineering may also benefit from the course material.

ussy,229,art mirrors art,3,"at the beginning of the renaissance, about the year 1400, an important new theme arose in painting, sculpture and printmaking--the theme of art about art.  at a time when the status of artists in society was rising, new subjects began to appear in western european art that depicted both the artist and the process of making art.  self portraits of artists, depictions of saint luke painting the virgin mary, images of women as artists and muses, classical and mythological stories of art making (pygmalion and galatea, apelles painting the mistress of alexander the great), depictions of painting and sculpture studios and of art academies and instruction, scenes of art galleries and collections, still lifes about art, all reflected this new cultural interest in art as a topic in itself.  this seminar will look at individual works of art and subject types to understand what they tell us about the role of the arts and the changing status of the artist in the renaissance and early modern period, up to the eve of the french revolution, about 1789.  the works we study will thus be understood as symbolic indicators of social status and ideas about what art meant to european society.

the goals of the course include: exploring the relationship between form and content in written and visual productions, developing a critical perspective from which to enjoy, assess, and respond creatively to traditional print and multimedia presentations, and making excellent use of research resources at cwru and cultural resources at university circle. in addition, students will work to develop their writing and presentation skills and to innovate novel models of research writing.

ussy,288j,cultural representations of violence,3,"the twentieth century was arguably the most violent in human history.  that legacy has carried into our own time: from 9/11 to school shootings to the recent conflict in libya, violence surrounds us.  but what exactly is violence?  how is it that we all recognize it when we see it?  how do we represent it to ourselves?  most importantly, how do we make sense of it?  can we make sense of it?  this class will explore these questions by studying the uneasy role violence plays in literature, film, performance art, and other cultural productions.  as we do so, we will consider two central and potentially conflicting ideas.  on the one hand, violence tends to resist our abilities to represent it; any depiction seems somehow inadequate to the real thing.  at the same time, representations of violence surround us constantly, and for any number of political, cultural, and social reasons.  thus, violence in modern and contemporary culture is paradoxical, both permeating and resisting our imaginations.  through class discussions, written responses, presentations, and independent research projects, we will explore these and other ideas, considering how art attempts to comprehend violence and how artistic representations of violence relate to (implicate?) their audience.  although our focus will be largely on art, and primarily literature, our approach will be necessarily interdisciplinary.  be prepared to weigh in on topics as diverse as politics, aesthetics, philosophy, gender and sexuality, war, trauma, and colonialism.  undoubtedly, violence can be a painful subject, but the goal of our seminar is to pursue a rigorous intellectual and imaginative inquiry into one of the most pressing topics of our time.

historically, gender segregation reaches into antiquity and existed in a variety of forms, cross-culturally. the term ""harem"" was not used regularly until the 13th century, and then only referred to the specific form of gender segregation used by the ottoman court. application of the word ""harem"" to all women's quarters in other cultures was the result of european contact with the ottoman empire, despite the fact that other cultures often had their own, distinct, terminology for women's spaces.

in this seminar, we will explore the history and practice of gender segregation as a means to examine how the idea of the harem was constructed in the eastern and western imagination. under what circumstances did women live separately? how were gendered spaces created, justified and maintained? where did our image of the harem come from? using primary and secondary sources, we will examine a selection of histories and representations of the harem in literature, slave and travel narratives, and religion. as the western idea of the harem is part of what edward said theorized as ""orientalism"", we will explore said's theory as well as subsequent theories related to gender and the exotic. in addition, we will look at images of women's quarters from antiquity to the present and listen to representations of the exotic in music. our goal is not only to study the historical fact of the harem, but also to engage issues related to gender, the exotic and representation from different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

ussy,288w,a history of noise: music and politics from beethoven to jimi hendrix,3,"this writing-intensive course examines the roles that noise has played in political discourses throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. its charged bookends--beethoven and jimi hendrix-- invite students to challenge supposed differences between ""art"" and popular music and examine relationships between music and society. ""who does 'art' serve?,"" ""is it possible to distinguish between 'art' and noise?,"" and ""is sound capable of influence at all?"" are among the chief questions this course explores. the curriculum's historical breadth allows students to consider these larger questions through a variety of case studies, including (among others) the bombast and nationalism of beethoven's ninth symphony; the marxist-inspired ""emancipation"" of sound, as presented by arnold schoenberg; the gender-bending metal of eddie van halen; and the protest-by-distortion of hendrix's national anthem at woodstock. by the end of this course, students will gain more awareness of the ways in which the music surrounding them seeks to shape society.

ussy,288y,shots in the dark: investigating crime films,3,"crime movies and their subgenres (gangster, film noir, detective, police) are the most enduringly popular of all hollywood genres.  they've been around since the silent era and attest to america's fascination with crime.  but another reason we are so attracted to crime films stems from a pair of contradictory narrative projects that underline the genre.  on the one hand, these films valorize the distinctions between the genre's stock characters--criminal, victim and avenger--in order to affirm the social, moral or institutional order.  on the other hand, crime movies explore the relations between the three roles in order to mount a critique that challenges that order.  in addition to emphasizing film studies, we will study the films for what they say about crime, criminals and criminal law.

as most crime films contain an investigation, so too will the organization of the course.  there are methods for analyzing film just as there are methods for investigating a crime scene.  investigation requires identifying, collecting, analyzing and interpreting evidence.  we'll start by investigating what makes the genre so enduring--its mise-en-scene, intent or characters?  you will be reporting your findings in three scholarly papers: a formal analysis on a specific film, a sociological analysis of a specific film and a research paper with documentation.

ussy,289a,do we have free will?,3,"concepts such as freedom, choice, moral responsibility, and autonomy are commonly invoked to describe our sense, as human beings, that our actions and thoughts are really our own. this seems like experiential commonsense-when i choose to read a novel instead of a philosophy text it feels like the decision to do so was made by me, that there was no coercion, or other seen or unseen force, that intervened to make me choose as i did. we extend this logic to the judgment of moral and legal responsibility. if you engage in good behavior, you get the praise; if you do bad things, you are blameworthy.

 despite our self-perception that we freely make decisions and choose our actions, we sometimes invoke the notion that certain events are the result of some prior cause or circumstance that determines what occurs in the present. in this instance, we do not appear to be fully free in our choices because we cannot undo the causes that dictate what is taking place here and now. to the extent that we experience current actions as having a cause in the past, we are flirting with the idea that our behavior is not wholly free, but determined or conditioned by what has come before. determinism, necessity, fate, destiny, predestination: these are terms typically used to describe the sense that our actions and thoughts are the result of unknown forces or circumstances beyond our control.

 this course uses classic and contemporary texts, taken from multiple cultural traditions, to explore the problem of free will and related issues of body/mind dualism and personal identity. although the term ""free will"" does not appear in all cultural contexts, found everywhere are questions of whether we are free to act and think as we wish or whether our thoughts and actions are in some way determined. we also read science fiction short stories as thought experiments in order to help us understand the ramifications of various positions on free will and related problems.

 this course is discussion-based and writing-intensive. classes focus on analysis and interpretation of texts and ideas.

ussy,289e,poets of ohio,3,"more often than not, contemporary society views poetry as a strange and dated art form. when the genre actually does receive recognition, it is usually under the guise of hip-hop or slam poetry. while both of those offshoots contain their own poetic and artistic merit, this course intends to familiarize you with contemporary, literary poetry and highlight the dynamic poetry community of ohio. luckily for us, many of the poets we will read during the course agreed to visit our class this semester to talk about their work and read their poems.
in addition to demonstrating that poetry is alive, well, and thriving all around us, we will also attempt to think critically about this genre. why do poetic texts, both of the present and the past, seem so difficult to read and understand? what writing techniques, strategies, and styles do poets use that make comprehending their work such a challenge? more importantly, why would anyone choose to write in this manner? through close readings of the primary texts, researching the historical and literary contexts surrounding contemporary poetry, and discussing the art form with each other (as well as with the poets themselves), we will come to a better understanding of how these texts function.
to this extent, our course will engage the symbolic world as we explore the local and national poetry communities, noting how writers found relationships upon geography, aesthetics, and demographics (just to name a few), using written texts to express some emotion, thought, or identity. in order to accomplish these goals, we will read, participate in class discussions, and write extensively about poetry composed by contemporary ohio poets. therefore, you will be expected to engage our course texts critically, thinking through the manner in which language operates as a tool for generating and sustaining, as well as undermining, community formation.

ussy,289i,the art of science,3,"this is an interdisciplinary course that will explore the intersection between two disparate but often-connected fields, the history of art and the history of science.  although these fields are separated on college campuses today, they share a history that is united by a common philosophical question: how do we evaluate and know the world around us?  the documentation of that knowledge is often visual--whether written or painted, tabulated or carved--images play an essential role in the shaping and recording of information. beginning with the renaissance revival of pliny's natural history (c. 77-79 bce) this class will focus on the complex ways in which science and art overlap and enrich one another. topics explored in this course include: mathematical theory and linear perspective; anatomical dissection and naturalism in figure painting; optics, lenses, and realism; copernicus, galileo and religious painting; botany and scientific illustration; natural history and fine art collecting, etc. classes will be supplemented by visits to the museum of natural history, the cleveland museum of art, and the dittrick museum of medical history.

ussy,289j,beauty myths today,3,"published just over 20 years ago, naomi wolf's influential study ""the beauty myth"" significantly influenced popular thinking about body image.  analyzing both cultural trends and empirical data, wolf argued that as women made unprecedented advances in public life in the latter half of the 20th century, they were at the same time held to increasingly unrealistic standards of physical beauty.  wolf's study not only contributed to extant analyses of sexism in the media, but also introduced to mainstream readers the politics of the representation of women's bodies in popular culture.  this course will examine to what extent wolf's original claim hold true today.  in other words, what physical standards must one meet in order to be considered professionally and personally successful?  in exploring this question, we will look at the origins and current workings of the american beauty industry, considering the changing representation of the ideal body throughout the 20th century.  we'll read texts by historians, philosophers, novelists, poets, cultural critics, and journalists who examine the politics of beauty. to both (re-)define and trace the continuing effects of beauty myths in the 21st century, we'll consider the rhetoric of ideal womanhood as it shows up in popular texts such as websites promoting anorexia, tv shows about plastic surgery, diet books, magazines, and guides for mothers.  students will have opportunities to define the beauty myth more broadly, exploring its effects on men and its mediating presence in other cultural sites.

ussy,291z,marriage plots,3,"why do so many stories end with a wedding? our course will consider the form of the marriage plot: we will look at how stories often begin with young(ish) people meeting and falling in love, and how the process of storytelling denies (or frustrates) their initial connection. through the telling of the story, however, the young lovers overcome obstacles in myriad forms: controlling parents, financial insecurity or class differences, religious difference, even magical spells. we will think about what these stories do for their readers and viewers. we will also think about how various other stories--of riots, of government, of dissatisfaction with life--get couched in marriage plots. what is it about a marriage plot that ensures stability, satisfies our desires, and gives us such necessary closure? how does the form of ""comedy""--for this is the overarching genre that relies so heavily upon marriage plots--work with and reshape the marriage plot over time? we'll also briefly ponder how supporters of marriage equality have used the marriage plot. finally, our investigation into the marriage plot will look at marriage plot comedies that refuse to conform to the typical marriage plot: dark humor from a novel like villette to films like harold and maude or the war of the roses. this course investigates the presence of the marriage plot across multiple literary genres: dramas, novels, film, and television. we will also read and view courtship narratives from across historical periods from the renaissance until today.

ussy,292a,drama and social protest movements,3,"the complicated relationship between drama and politics dates back to at least ancient greece. today, playwrights continue to use political conflict as the basis for dramatic action, as well as use their plays to spark political protest--at times even risking imprisonment or exile. in this course, we will read a collection of protest plays alongside accounts of the protest movements that the plays and playwrights either depicted or participated in. as part of our investigation, we will ask the following questions:  what do these plays tell us about the performative and emotional work done by protest?  what role does theatricality play in the acts of persuasion, criticism, and direct action normally associated with political protest? do these plays simply reproduce the goals and criticisms of protest movements, or does drama invite a style of social critique that sets it apart from other forms of political speech?  do these plays present protest as focused on the personal grievances of characters, or do they criticize larger social systems like class, gender, and racial hierarchy?  we will also spend some class time discussing a few more modern anti-war, anti-racist and feminist protest movements, exploring the aesthetics and theatricality of protest and the extent to which they further political change.

ussy,292c,the moral suspicion of money,3,"money is morally suspicious--the root of all sorts of evil. this suspicion isn't merely that bad people do bad things with money; it is that somehow the use of money helps make otherwise good people bad. but money is everywhere, pervasive and practical, and so a technology we both need and distrust. money prices give us reasons when deciding what to do. but we think that money often gives us ""good"" reasons to do bad things and bad reasons to do good things. and sometimes assigning certain things monetary values at all seems unreasonable. we use money to express our values, yet complain money often distorts them, or has become a value itself. we use money to relate to each other in mutually beneficial commerce and trade, but worry that money degrades our relations.

in this interdisciplinary course we'll investigate the birth of both money and the idea of its badness. we'll survey history, literature, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, film, and the day's news for culturally varied expressions of, and reactions to, this suspicion. we'll first ask, ""what is money?"" (""how do things like rocks, metals, shells, or data-bits become, and continue to be, money?"") and ""what is morality?"" (""what might we mean when we claim some act, person, situation, or system is morally better or worse?""). we'll then consider specific suspicions and morally evaluate them, along the way raising questions such as: why can i rent myself out as a landscaper but not as a prostitute? is the iranian kidney market better than u.s. waiting lists, or ""bio-violence?"" should americans with slave ancestors be paid for their family past? is there a moral difference between a corporate raider and a pirate? what is aristotle's explanation for why capitalists often produce crap? why might nietzsche think wall street's gordon gekko might be right that ""greed is good?? what does marx mean when he claims money-driven markets are ""alienating?"" if money expresses our values, ought anything be above money? is anything beyond price?

ussy,292i,the cinema of otherness,3,"one way that humans understand themselves is to consider some counterpart entity--an other--against which the self can be understood.  this other, though perhaps based on knowledge of a real person or people, is always shaped by the self's projected fears and desires.  at a cultural level, these projections result in generally held stereotypes that the powerful use to maintain their superior position in a hierarchical relationship.  movies are one place where stereotypes of the other are created and maintained.  movies shape how we see, think and feel toward the other.  in this course, we will attempt to understand how film manufactures otherness by studying several key hollywood movies.  we will examine their use of racial and ethnic categories of otherness, as well as how they position the viewing self as white. we will also examine other sites of difference, such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, bodily disfigurement, paying special attention to symbolic representations of these differences in the form of robots, monsters and aliens.

ussy,292k,21st century american theater,3,"with its roots tracing back to ancient greece, theater is one of our earliest forms of storytelling and entertainment.  however, in the age of streaming video on demand, and massively multiplayer online games, can this venerable art form still be considered relevant, when even our movie multiplexes are going by the wayside?  recent broadway musicals such as hamilton have certainly made a powerful case for the theater's continued relevancy, simultaneously breaking box office records and offering innovative approaches to content and form while appealing to younger and non-traditional theater audiences.  
in this seminar we will consider a number of major plays and musicals produced on and off broadway since the year 2000. among the questions to be considered over the course of the semester: what does it mean to create and experience theater in the context of emerging technologies?  has theater continued to evolve to address the changing needs and sensibilities of 21st century audiences?  in what ways does it provide a voice to marginalized social groups?
in addition to readings and class discussions, students will also be required to attend live performances (both professional and academic) and compose essays offering informed critiques evaluating particular aspects of the theatrical whole.

ussy,292n,"cli-fi: addressing climate change in fact, fiction, and film",3,"this seminar examines the emerging literary genre of cli-fi, or climate fiction, which bridges genres such as science fiction and apocalyptic literature as it depicts imagined responses to the damage wrought by global climate change. in the early 1960s, well in advance of compelling scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change, novelists were already speculating about the effects of global warming. focusing on fiction, films, and non-fiction writing from the past three decades, we will consider how authors envision the effects of climate change. specifically, we will read works by historians, journalists, philosophers, scientists, and cultural critics as a foundation for our analysis of several works of fiction. further, we will consider how visual media, like feature and documentary films, depict the impacts of climate change. centrally, we will evaluate how climate fiction complements existing popular and academic conversations about our transforming world. ultimately, responding to the broadening field of narratives about human-generated transformations of the world, we will address climate fiction's potential to influence ethical paths shaped by those who seek to alter the disastrous trajectory that the genre imagines.

over the course of the semester, we'll be studying the changing forms hamlet has taken. we'll think first about the inspirations for shakespeare's play in danish sagas and roman tragedy, and subsequently read hamlet alongside a variety of reinterpretations and revisions in different media (from short stories, to films, to videogames) spanning 400 years and hailing from across the globe.
we will learn about the cultural, social and political contexts that shape how adaptations are produced and received. we'll also think critically about the elements that constitute a particular work of art in a particular medium, and about the processes through which new works can be made out of old ones.

ussy,292q,the secret lives of animals,3,"animals are instructive. when we study animals, their biological makeups and creaturely habits, we do so with hopes of learning something about them. at the same time, such investigations often betray an interest in our human selves. the study of animals, in scientific and literary laboratories alike, quickly turns to acts of self-discovery: not what it means to be animal, exactly, but what it means to be human-animals. so what more could we learn by cultivating new strategies for listening and new languages for communicating with animals?

this seminar invites students to investigate the secret lives of animals as imagined in a sampling of classical, medieval and modern literatures. thinking with animals past and present--in fables, manuals, and tales--we will examine human-animal relationships in imagined settings. over the course of the semester, we will read, view, listen, and perform works in which animals are tasked with teaching moral lessons and testing the ethical obligations of their human audiences. comparing treatments of companion animals past and present, we will reflect on the many ways literature can guide our evolving relationship to the animal kingdom.

ussy,292s,the meaning of life: a novel idea,3,"according to the critic walter benjamin, while short stories can convey a moral, ""the 'meaning of life' is really the center about which the novel moves."" many critics share this view, arguing that the very idea of ""the meaning of life"" emerges alongside of the novel genre because of the ways novels portray individuals thinking about their lives. novels characters internally reflect, make choices, and interact with others--often over long periods of time and through many changing circumstances. furthermore, they depict how characters--personal choices--are influenced by a variety of external, social forces. in doing so, novels have offered their readers ways to think about what they value, and why. 

this seminar will take up the novel genre as a way to think carefully and deeply about just what the idea of ""the meaning of life"" involves. we will discuss how various novels have addressed--and continue to address--the desire for fulfillment and purpose. we will begin by examining how it came to be that novels came to be associated with and helped create the very concept of the ""meaning of life."" then we read some classic novels to examine how the novel has portrayed the meaning of life. we will conclude the course with a contemporary novel and ask whether or not contemporary novels are creating experiences of meaning in the same way they did hundreds of years ago. if they are, is that meaning still the same? if not, are novels asking different kinds of big questions? is ""the meaning of life"" not as vital as it used to be to how novels work? in addressing these questions we will strive to understand the history of this literary form, its uses for our own personal introspection and ethical thinking, as well as the continuing role of novels in our rapidly evolving society.

usna,252,the future of food,3,"since world war ii, science and technology have transformed the way americans produce and consume food.  this transformation has been supported by government policies and accomplished through the application of industrial methods in agriculture, food processing, and food delivery.  such methods have allowed a tiny fraction of the american population to produce vast quantities of food products at very low prices for american consumers.  

but this american diet, while inexpensive, has turned out to be high in sugar, fat, and processed grains that are contributing to chronic disease such as diabetes and obesity.  in addition, environmental impacts of confined animal feeding operations, vast monoculture grain production, and global food transport are raising questions about the sustainability of american agribusiness.  

this seminar will explore the evolution of food production in the united states since world war ii and will ask the question: is it possible to nourish the world's population using nutrition and flavor as guiding principles rather than cost?  what is the true meaning of ""sustainability"" in agriculture?  the last third of the course will be devoted to creating a plan for using part of the university farm to grow food for the university.

usna,265,thinking national parks,3,"this seminar provides students an opportunity to explore u.s. national parks and their history of displaying both nature and culture.  this discussion-based, writing- and research-focused class requires students to examine a park system that is both extraordinarily popular and rife with controversy.  we begin with several recurring questions: where did the national parks idea come from?  how has the park mission evolved and adapted?  can parks be ""read"" as texts, and if so, how does our point of view determine what we see?  how do parks arrange displays of cultural and natural worlds, and how do they display interactions therein?  how can changing park philosophies be reflected in their physical apparatus and infrastructure?

students will participate in regular class discussions, occasionally lead these same discussions, complete formal writing assignments, and develop a final research project.  the course readings will alternate between historical and present-day selections, so that we explore the history of u.s. national parks while simultaneously considering challenges and controversies that matter very much today.  early readings will include john muir and gifford pinchot; current trends will be explored in the writings of william cronon, alfred runte, and jennifer price, among many others.  we will view significant portions of ken burns' recent pbs series the national parks: america's best idea.

the ultimate ""text"" for the class, however, is an actual national park.  each student will choose a national park as the basis for their semester-long project.  students will begin with description and history of their park, and then they will explore controversies or other issues in the park, developing their own argument.  next, students will have a chance to play architect/landscaper/park-superintendent, as they propose a change to the park that would address an existing problem or enhance the visitors' experience.  finally, students will gather these pieces into a single coherent project, submitting a 10-15 page final essay as well as producing an engaging class presentation.

usna,266,life after the death of print,3,"around 1439, johannes gutenberg invented the moveable type printing press, a technological development that altered the world by ushering in an era of mass, reproducible communication.  for nearly 500 years, print technologies have dominated communications.  scholars have shown that print's ability to disseminate information led to revolutions in art, science and politics.  in short, print technologies have largely defined what it means to be a thinking and communicating human being.  the emergence of digital technologies has altered communications in ways that are only now being understood.  this course examines how developments in digital technologies impact communication practices by threatening print's historic stronghold.  consequently, the course also explores what impact new technologies have on human identity.  we will consider the historical development of display technologies (printed materials and digital screens) to understand what is at stake in the move from print to digital communication.  we will then investigate current phenomena associated with web 2.0, including blogs and social networks, in order to understand how our communication choices construct and allow for our public and private identities.  additionally, the course will examine new display technologies, such as iphones and kindles, that allow for the possibly constant dissemination of those identities.  finally, we will hypothesize about how digital technologies force us to conceive of human identity differently from the ways that print invites.

cosmology is the subject that seeks to answer the big questions. as such, it is the nexus where science, philosophy, and religion collide. this course will explore the subject of cosmology, from both an historical and scientific perspective. in the process, we will examine the roles of faith, philosophy, and empirical knowledge. we will survey prevailing attitudes towards the nature of the world model over time, examining the impact of belief systems on the interpretation of physical evidence. subjects to be covered include the first vital steps of the ancient philosophers, the tension between geocentric and heliocentric world models at the time of copernicus and galileo, and the modern scientific world view.

students will learn to critically examine evidence and its interpretation, and to appreciate the strengths and shortcomings of various forms of human knowledge. emphasis will be placed on the importance and limitations of empirical evidence, and the dangers inherent in the interpretation of evidence within a preconceived framework. the student will gain an appreciation for the historical development of world models, culminating with modern cosmology. in the process comes a respect for the diverse paths to knowledge followed by humanity.

usna,287h,plants in medicine,3,"plants have always been the basis of medicinal treatments, and as they continue to be essential to modern forms of medicine, alternative and traditional alike.  in this course, we will consider the history of how humans have used particular plants for medicinal purposes, such as the cinchona tree (cinchona officinalis) for quinine, willow bark (salix) for aspirin, and the yew tree (taxus baccata) for the cancer medication paclitaxel.  by investigating how a plant is used medicinally through time, we will also come to understand the culture that used it and how they conceived of health in relationship to nature.  we will read texts that show how a plant's medicinal uses can be tied to colonialism and global exploration.  for example, the first botanical gardens were collections of medicinal plants cultivated for use and experimentation, often containing non-native plant-based cures discovered through colonial contact.  while this is not a course in botany per se, we will be discussing basic plant biology, cultivation practices, and the contemporary science of using plants as the basis for pharmaceutical cures.  students should be active course participants in class discussion and on field trips.  writing instruction will focus on research-based argument, and students will complete a researched essay focusing on a medicinal plant of their choice.

usna,287j,transportation in american life,3,"we will explore the critical role of transportation in the development of our cities, regions, states, and nation. the course will consider the historic role of transportation, its current role, and what role it might play in the future. transportation will be viewed in the context of national policies, overall political will, and our culture at large.

since colonial times, transportation, in its many forms, has been the subject of intense debate, governmental policies, as well as the subject of public and private investment. we will see how certain individuals and groups used ego, power, and wealth to use transportation for shaping the nation's commerce, travel patterns, and physical appearance. we'll also see the evolution of government and business in transportation decisions and funding.

finally, because of transportation's daily impact, we will look at current issues as part of every class. we will especially focus on the transportation issues of northeast ohio, a microcosm of national transportation issues. some of these issues include funding, decision-making, land use, ""suburban sprawl,"" and economic development. we'll also look at transportation issues specific to the university circle area such as the health line and the proposed ""opportunity corridor.""

usna,287p,women and science: changing paradigms,3,"is science objectively neutral in that true scientific knowledge would be independent of the discoverer? in this view, the scientific discoverer is more like a midwife that brings forth pre-existing knowledge to the world. or - is scientific knowledge guided and shaped by the people who practice science, in which case it is influenced by the social context in which it occurs, making the scientist more like a sculptor who creates something new using the tools that are currently available.

in this course we will examine this second question by looking specifically at the relationship of gender to science through several lenses. one approach we will use is make case studies of the lives of major women scientists and the way that their gender impacted their work, from the type of scientific research they pursued, the kind of support and encouragement that they obtained as they proceeded in their careers, to the rewards and recognition (or the lack of them) that their work received from their peers.

using a more conjectural line of inquiry, we will also consider the role that gender might have played in developing scientific theories and whether there can be such categories as ""masculinist"" and ""feminist"" science. we will conclude this part of our inquiry with an analysis of the current state of science and how well these approaches reflect the way science is pursued today.

a third issue involves looking at the relationship of gender and science but from the opposite direction. in other words, we will consider how science has influenced our understanding of gender, rather than how gender has influenced science. over time, scientific ideas about the physiological and intellectual differences between males and females have changed dramatically several times with major political and sociological ramifications. consequently, we will examine the science of gender in its cultural and political context from antiquity through the twentieth century. 

in order to explore these interweaving threads, we will be taking an interdisciplinary approach that will draw on the history and philosophy of science (particularly thomas kuhn's the revolution of scientific ideas), as well as on anthropology and cultural theory. by the conclusion of the course we will have examined the scientific evidence that has supported assumptions about gender in various philosophical paradigms, including humanism, rationalism (i.e., enlightenment philosophy), nineteenth century moralism, modernism, and postmodernism.

usna,288w,medieval sciences and human difference: how did medieval peoples define humanity?,3,"since the beginning of recorded history, humans have employed different approaches to defining themselves in relation to the natural world. along with folklore, religion and philosophy, science has been an important means to define concepts we now refer to as race/ethnicity, dis/ability, sexuality, and gender. however, what constituted science and scientific inquiry varied widely based on culture and historical context. most recently, our advancing understanding of genetics has produced ever more nuanced definitions of human difference, even as we have come to recognize that such explanations often compete with theories that are grounded in social and cultural values, rather than scientific observation. how did people explain human diversity in the 1000 years before the scientific revolution unfolded in europe? 
in this seminar, we will investigate how different medieval cultures explained humanity and human diversity by sampling examples of medical observation, philosophy, theories about the natural world, cultural prejudice, and religious belief. in particular, we will consider how greek, roman, chinese, indian, islamicate, and early european theories of human difference shaped justifications for conquest as, gender roles and sexuality, often in surprising ways. questions we will ask include: how did medieval people differentiate humans from animals? did they use the same categories of race, gender, and sexuality that we use? how did scientific thinking evolve to construct these taxonomies of difference? how were ideas shared cross-culturally? to explore these questions, we will read primary texts in translation from the medieval period. through our discussions, we will consider not only what other approaches to defining human differences can teach us, but how they provide historical insight into frameworks and assumptions about diversity today.

usna,289n,the mind's essential tension,3,"the idea that the mind is fundamentally divided has been around from ancient to modern times. sometimes this division is explicitly claimed to be a critical feature of human nature; other times it is expressed as different ways of being-in or experiencing the world; in yet other cases the focus is on contrasting domains that the mind either apprehends or creates. examples include: yin vs. yang, spiritual vs material, numinous vs. mundane, masculine vs. feminine, mind vs. body/matter, theoretical vs. practical reason, science vs. arts/humanities, reason vs. passion, normative vs descriptive, fact vs. value, poetry vs. prose, to have vs. to be, doing vs. being, left brain vs. right brain, empathizing vs. systemizing, thinking fast vs. slow.
there can be no doubt that the notion of a divided mind has proven intuitively appealing to many. however, to what degree is such an idea supported by careful and rigorous scholarship? each of the claimed divisions listed above has been critiqued, often ferociously and with good reason. however, there is also a compelling case to be made for the presence of a division. strong examples come from numerous disciplines: from philosophy, work on ethics and aesthetics, in the continental tradition, and on the problems of consciousness and free will; from psychology, work on decision making (prospect theory) and thinking styles; from neuroscience, work on the network structure of the brain.
in this class, we will be focused on asking the following questions: is there a fundamental division in the mind? if so, what is the nature of the division? why is it helpful to claim a division--what work does it do? how is it unhelpful? to what degree are apparent divisions products of culture and context, vs. biology? how might a scientific account of the division transform our understanding of historically influential divisions? how might historical and/or philosophical work inform current scientific research?

usso,271,schoolhouse rocked: education reform,3,"today, the term ""education reform"" may bring to mind standardized tests and no child left behind. many believe that our schools must become more rigorous, with stricter rules and definable goals. ""reform,"" however, used to be defined differently. john dewey, maria montessori, and paulo-freire, for example, struggled to make schools freer and more humane. they hoped not to make the classroom less challenging, but more child-centered. some disciples of such reformers, discouraged by schools' resistance to change, eventually turned to homeschooling--pulling kids out of school and educating them with real-life learning experiences. in this seminar, we will explore progressive educational theory and connect it with contemporary alternative schools and homeschooling. visits to nearby montessori and waldorf schools and discussions with homeschoolers will make real-life connections to seminar reading and classwork. challenging assumptions about how well our schools work and raising questions such as, ""how do we learn?"" and ""what is good teaching?"" will provoke thought, conversation, and interesting writing.

in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, we are witnessing the ""flattening"" of the world due to the technological revolution, a phenomenon brought about by the instant and worldwide generation of and access to information.  two major consequences of this evolution are: a) individuals are more empowered than at any time in history and the traditional societal structure is under constant challenge; b) companies have changed their business structures and practices and have begun to operate on a truly global scale.

usso,287t,"gender, visibility and performance: the courtesan",3,"throughout history, the figure of the courtesan has embodied seduction, performance, and mystery; occupying the private spaces of the real and the imaginary across cultures.  the impact of the courtesan on society can be seen in travelogues, poetry, and historical treatises, as well as in texts written specifically about courtesans themselves.  those cultures which had a courtesan class frequently experienced varying degrees of social discomfort.  within the culture, there was tension between those who patronized courtesans and those who considered them a social menace.  from without, cultures which had courtesans were believed to be either excessively decadent or highly civilized, depending on the cultural standpoint of the observer.  
in this seminar, we will study real courtesans as well as examine the figure of the courtesan within the context of literature, religion, music history, and gender theory.  the seminar will begin with an overview of the origins of the courtesan, focused on the roles of women and slave musicians in the court and temple in egypt, india, greece, and mesopotamia starting in 3,000 bce.  then, we will explore factors leading to the development of a courtesan class and compare the roles of courtesans and their place in their culture in europe, india, asia, and the middle east.  readings and class discussion will encompass issues relating to the impact of gender on performance, literary genres, education, and social and legal status, as well as continuing questions related to translation of primary sources, colonialism, and religious movements.  in addition to the readings, we will also study images of the courtesan from antiquity to the present, listen to music by and about courtesans, sample some of their writing, and watch films about ""real"" courtesans.  the primary goal is not only to look at the impact of courtesans in history, but also to engage issues related to gender and performance from a variety of different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

in this seminar, we will use a chronological framework to examine the institution of slavery, uses for slaves, methodologies and sources for studying slavery and the slave trade in world history. beginning with slavery in the ancient near east, egypt, greece and rome, the class will include slavery and the feudal system in medieval europe, indentured servitude and concubinage, slaves in the early islamic courts, the ottoman slave trade, the african slave trade and slavery in the americas, and the current problem of human trafficking. within each section, students will read primary texts and recent scholarship examining the social, economic and religious rationales behind slavery. we will also study different methodologies and the impact of gender, race and social class on the study of world slavery. as many slaver cultures had different definitions for what it meant to be a slave, we will address questions related to translation, interpretation and perception when dealing with primary sources. the primary goal of the course is to provide a broader context for the institution of slavery in world history as a means not only to understand the impact of slavery has had on american culture, but on other cultures as well.
