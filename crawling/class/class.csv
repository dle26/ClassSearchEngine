-corporate development strategy through capabilities and leveragable capabilities
-before venturing into a new business, the firm has to have a clear understanding of the critical capabilities required for success in the new business.
-firms can increase the odds of success if they can leverage  (parts of ) existing capabilities to new businesses.
-corporate development strategies-adapting to a market
-analyze the industry environment in order to select the competitive battlefield to increase the odds of success by leveraging some of your existing capabilities - sometimes also known as core competencies.  this is a relatively low risk strategy.  we will develop methodologies that will allow you to identify markets (segments) where your current capabilities are leveragable.
-shaping a market usually requires developing a completely new set of capabilities - very risky.  we will develop concepts to understand techniques to mitigate these risks.
-acquisitions as one of the means for corporate development
-approximately half of the class sessions will be devoted to the specific case of acquisitions as a means to expand the boundaries of a firm.  we will explore both how acquisitions contribute to competitive advantage and the selection process and integration of the acquired entity.  less emphasis will be placed on strict financial valuations and negotiations.

emba,446,managing risk and real options,2,"the course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  in the finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  you studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, npv, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  the first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  the course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  we look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  the second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. in competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  as soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, dcf, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  a better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed.

emba,451,business model design,2,"in most companies the process of designing business models is an ad hoc process and in my opinion an inefficient process.  in this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  we will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  the first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  the second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  this seems easy because everything is in english and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  however, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.

you will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.  after the completion of this course you should be quickly able to draw the outline of a business model for any business opportunity that you're considering.

emse,468,scientific writing in materials science and engineering,3,"for writing a thesis (or a publication) in the field of materials science and engineering, students need a diverse set of skills in addition to mastering the scientific content. generally, scientific writing requires proficiency in document organization, professional presentation of numerical and graphical data, literature retrieval and management, text processing, version control, graphical illustration, mathematical typesetting, the english language, elements of style, etc. scientific writing in materials science and engineering, specifically, requires additional knowledge about e.g. conventions of numerical precision, error limits, mathematical typesetting, proper use of units, proper digital processing of micrographs, etc. having to acquire these essential skills at the beginning of thesis (or publication) writing may compromise the outcome by distracting from the most important task of composing the best possible scientific content.
this course properly prepares students for scientific writing with a comprehensive spectrum of knowledge, skills, and tools enabling them to fully focus on the scientific content of their thesis or publication when the time has come to start writing. similar to artistic drawing, where the ability to ""see"" is as (or more!) important as skills of the hand, the ability of proper scientific writing is intimately linked to the ability of critically reviewing scientific texts. therefore, students will practice both authoring and critical reviewing of material science texts. to sharpen students' skills of reviewing, examples of good and less good scientific writing will be taken from published literature of materials science and engineering and analyzed in the context of knowledge acquired in the course. at the end of the course, students will have set up skills and a highly functional work environment to start writing their role thesis or article with full focus on the scientific content. while the course mainly targets students of materials science and engineering, students of other disciplines of science and engineering may also benefit from the course material.

econ,375,economics of developing countries,3,"this course focuses on international aspects of economic development. the term ""developing country"" is often defined as a country that exhibits low per capita income, high poverty level, low level of industrialization, or low life expectancy. in terms of size, the developing countries make up at least three-fourth of the world population. why do we study those countries' economies separately from the industrialized economies? in fact, low economic growth, high unemployment, or high poverty rates also exist in many developed countries. the differences lie not in the types of problems but in the causes of these problems. in addition, differences in the kind of institutions that prevail in developing countries also lead to different policy prescriptions. among developing countries, differences in historical experience, cultural practices, political institutions and economic conditions are also enormous. illustrations and explanations of those differences are provided from a wide range of developing countries.
prereq:"
econ,376,inside the financial crisis,3,"this is a case study in the events surrounding the 2007 global financial crisis. the course will build from fundamental economic concepts into a comprehensive analysis of the elements, which led to the collapse and the contemporary policy debates about the recovery. the background for debate will come from an analysis of: housing and housing finance; bank runs and bear sterns; mortgage backed securities; and toxic asset purchases. the course will then examine major components of the dodd-frank act and enable students to assess whether the act will address the causes of the 2007 crisis and more importantly establish the conditions to prevent a future crisis.
prereq:"
econ,377,topics in monetary policy,3,"central banks have become enormously powerful economic institutions in many countries, yet their purposes and functions are widely misunderstood. this course is designed to enrich one's understanding of how central banks, such as the federal reserve system, actually operate; how they have been adapting to changes in the economic and financial landscape; and how they have been adapting to changes in technology. the course will highlight current monetary policy and central banking issues being dealt with in the united states and elsewhere. the course will emphasize the connection between economic theory and the practice of central banking. where relevant, topics will be examined from a multi-country perspective, so that the practices of several different countries may be compared and contrasted.
prereq:"
econ,378,health care economics,3,"healthcare accounts for over one-sixth of the u.s. national economy and over one-eighth of its workforce, shares that have dramatically increased over the last 50 years. the rapid growth in healthcare spending has accompanied growing concerns about the quality and efficiency of u.s. healthcare delivery and persistent disparities in access to care. are these concerns justified? if so, what can policymakers do - and what are they doing - to address them? the purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills necessary for understanding how the u.s. health care sector operates, how it has evolved, the forces at work behind perceived deficiencies (in access, quality and cost control), and the expected impact of alternative policy proposals. these issues are addressed through the lens of microeconomic theory. under this framework, outcomes result from the interaction of decisions made by participants in the healthcare economy (e.g. patients, providers, insurers, government), with those decisions governed by the preferences, incentives and resource constraints facing each decision-maker. this course should be of particular interest to students who envision future careers in healthcare delivery, healthcare management, pharmaceutical and device innovation, health insurance or public health, as well as other policy-oriented students seeking to understand the contentious issues in healthcare policymaking.
prereq:"
econ,386,urban economics,3,"microeconomic theory as taught in principles (and even intermediate) does not usually take into account the fact that goods, people, and information must travel in order to interact. rather, markets are implicitly modeled as if everyone and everything is at a single point in space. in the first part of the course, we will examine the implications of spatial location for economic analysis. in the second part of the class, we will use microeconomic tools to understand urban problems. topics that we will cover include urban growth, suburbanization, land use, poverty, housing, local government, transportation, education, and crime.

econ,395,the economy in the american century,3,"this class provides an approved sages capstone experience for economics majors.  it uses american economic history as an arena for a culminating application of the diverse knowledge and skills students have acquired during their undergraduate careers.  the twentieth century american economy was shaped by a series of transformations that make our lives profoundly different from those lived by americans in 1900.  attempting to understand these transformations has shaped the discipline of economics.  events and processes such as mass migration, the great depression, the growth of women's participation in the workforce, and suburbanization generated questions that economists developed theories and bodies of empirical evidence to answer.  students will synthesize knowledge accumulated in their prior undergraduate study to tackle big questions posed by the history of the american economy during the 20th century.  these questions cover the spectrum of economic life and scholarship, from finance and technology to human capital and gender.  students form teams to tackle an important question developed in consultation with the instructor.  each team will be responsible for educating the class on their research findings through researching and delivering a class-length presentation and preparing readings and exam questions.  students will produce an individual final paper related to their team's topic that expresses their own scholarly perspective and interest. counts as sages senior capstone.

econ,431,economics of negotiation and conflict resolution,3,"students frequently enroll in a negotiation class with one thought in mind--negotiating a better job offer from an employer. they soon learn, however, that negotiation skills can do far more than improve a paycheck. negotiations occur everywhere: in marriages, in divorces, in small work teams, in large organizations, in getting a job, in losing a job, in deal making, in decision making, in board rooms, and in court rooms. the remarkable thing about negotiations is that, wherever they occur, they are governed by similar principles. the current wave of corporate restructuring makes the study of negotiations especially important for m.b.a.s. mergers, acquisitions, downsizing and joint ventures call into question well established business and employment relationships. navigating these choppy waters by building new relationships requires the negotiation skills that you will learn in this class.

usna,252,the future of food,3,"since world war ii, science and technology have transformed the way americans produce and consume food.  this transformation has been supported by government policies and accomplished through the application of industrial methods in agriculture, food processing, and food delivery.  such methods have allowed a tiny fraction of the american population to produce vast quantities of food products at very low prices for american consumers.  

but this american diet, while inexpensive, has turned out to be high in sugar, fat, and processed grains that are contributing to chronic disease such as diabetes and obesity.  in addition, environmental impacts of confined animal feeding operations, vast monoculture grain production, and global food transport are raising questions about the sustainability of american agribusiness.  

this seminar will explore the evolution of food production in the united states since world war ii and will ask the question: is it possible to nourish the world's population using nutrition and flavor as guiding principles rather than cost?  what is the true meaning of ""sustainability"" in agriculture?  the last third of the course will be devoted to creating a plan for using part of the university farm to grow food for the university.

usna,265,thinking national parks,3,"this seminar provides students an opportunity to explore u.s. national parks and their history of displaying both nature and culture.  this discussion-based, writing- and research-focused class requires students to examine a park system that is both extraordinarily popular and rife with controversy.  we begin with several recurring questions: where did the national parks idea come from?  how has the park mission evolved and adapted?  can parks be ""read"" as texts, and if so, how does our point of view determine what we see?  how do parks arrange displays of cultural and natural worlds, and how do they display interactions therein?  how can changing park philosophies be reflected in their physical apparatus and infrastructure?

students will participate in regular class discussions, occasionally lead these same discussions, complete formal writing assignments, and develop a final research project.  the course readings will alternate between historical and present-day selections, so that we explore the history of u.s. national parks while simultaneously considering challenges and controversies that matter very much today.  early readings will include john muir and gifford pinchot; current trends will be explored in the writings of william cronon, alfred runte, and jennifer price, among many others.  we will view significant portions of ken burns' recent pbs series the national parks: america's best idea.

the ultimate ""text"" for the class, however, is an actual national park.  each student will choose a national park as the basis for their semester-long project.  students will begin with description and history of their park, and then they will explore controversies or other issues in the park, developing their own argument.  next, students will have a chance to play architect/landscaper/park-superintendent, as they propose a change to the park that would address an existing problem or enhance the visitors' experience.  finally, students will gather these pieces into a single coherent project, submitting a 10-15 page final essay as well as producing an engaging class presentation.

usna,266,life after the death of print,3,"around 1439, johannes gutenberg invented the moveable type printing press, a technological development that altered the world by ushering in an era of mass, reproducible communication.  for nearly 500 years, print technologies have dominated communications.  scholars have shown that print's ability to disseminate information led to revolutions in art, science and politics.  in short, print technologies have largely defined what it means to be a thinking and communicating human being.  the emergence of digital technologies has altered communications in ways that are only now being understood.  this course examines how developments in digital technologies impact communication practices by threatening print's historic stronghold.  consequently, the course also explores what impact new technologies have on human identity.  we will consider the historical development of display technologies (printed materials and digital screens) to understand what is at stake in the move from print to digital communication.  we will then investigate current phenomena associated with web 2.0, including blogs and social networks, in order to understand how our communication choices construct and allow for our public and private identities.  additionally, the course will examine new display technologies, such as iphones and kindles, that allow for the possibly constant dissemination of those identities.  finally, we will hypothesize about how digital technologies force us to conceive of human identity differently from the ways that print invites.

cosmology is the subject that seeks to answer the big questions. as such, it is the nexus where science, philosophy, and religion collide. this course will explore the subject of cosmology, from both an historical and scientific perspective. in the process, we will examine the roles of faith, philosophy, and empirical knowledge. we will survey prevailing attitudes towards the nature of the world model over time, examining the impact of belief systems on the interpretation of physical evidence. subjects to be covered include the first vital steps of the ancient philosophers, the tension between geocentric and heliocentric world models at the time of copernicus and galileo, and the modern scientific world view.

students will learn to critically examine evidence and its interpretation, and to appreciate the strengths and shortcomings of various forms of human knowledge. emphasis will be placed on the importance and limitations of empirical evidence, and the dangers inherent in the interpretation of evidence within a preconceived framework. the student will gain an appreciation for the historical development of world models, culminating with modern cosmology. in the process comes a respect for the diverse paths to knowledge followed by humanity.

since colonial times, transportation, in its many forms, has been the subject of intense debate, governmental policies, as well as the subject of public and private investment. we will see how certain individuals and groups used ego, power, and wealth to use transportation for shaping the nation's commerce, travel patterns, and physical appearance. we'll also see the evolution of government and business in transportation decisions and funding.

finally, because of transportation's daily impact, we will look at current issues as part of every class. we will especially focus on the transportation issues of northeast ohio, a microcosm of national transportation issues. some of these issues include funding, decision-making, land use, ""suburban sprawl,"" and economic development. we'll also look at transportation issues specific to the university circle area such as the health line and the proposed ""opportunity corridor.""

usna,287p,women and science: changing paradigms,3,"is science objectively neutral in that true scientific knowledge would be independent of the discoverer? in this view, the scientific discoverer is more like a midwife that brings forth pre-existing knowledge to the world. or - is scientific knowledge guided and shaped by the people who practice science, in which case it is influenced by the social context in which it occurs, making the scientist more like a sculptor who creates something new using the tools that are currently available.

in this course we will examine this second question by looking specifically at the relationship of gender to science through several lenses. one approach we will use is make case studies of the lives of major women scientists and the way that their gender impacted their work, from the type of scientific research they pursued, the kind of support and encouragement that they obtained as they proceeded in their careers, to the rewards and recognition (or the lack of them) that their work received from their peers.

using a more conjectural line of inquiry, we will also consider the role that gender might have played in developing scientific theories and whether there can be such categories as ""masculinist"" and ""feminist"" science. we will conclude this part of our inquiry with an analysis of the current state of science and how well these approaches reflect the way science is pursued today.

a third issue involves looking at the relationship of gender and science but from the opposite direction. in other words, we will consider how science has influenced our understanding of gender, rather than how gender has influenced science. over time, scientific ideas about the physiological and intellectual differences between males and females have changed dramatically several times with major political and sociological ramifications. consequently, we will examine the science of gender in its cultural and political context from antiquity through the twentieth century. 

in order to explore these interweaving threads, we will be taking an interdisciplinary approach that will draw on the history and philosophy of science (particularly thomas kuhn's the revolution of scientific ideas), as well as on anthropology and cultural theory. by the conclusion of the course we will have examined the scientific evidence that has supported assumptions about gender in various philosophical paradigms, including humanism, rationalism (i.e., enlightenment philosophy), nineteenth century moralism, modernism, and postmodernism.

usna,288w,medieval sciences and human difference: how did medieval peoples define humanity?,3,"since the beginning of recorded history, humans have employed different approaches to defining themselves in relation to the natural world. along with folklore, religion and philosophy, science has been an important means to define concepts we now refer to as race/ethnicity, dis/ability, sexuality, and gender. however, what constituted science and scientific inquiry varied widely based on culture and historical context. most recently, our advancing understanding of genetics has produced ever more nuanced definitions of human difference, even as we have come to recognize that such explanations often compete with theories that are grounded in social and cultural values, rather than scientific observation. how did people explain human diversity in the 1000 years before the scientific revolution unfolded in europe? 
in this seminar, we will investigate how different medieval cultures explained humanity and human diversity by sampling examples of medical observation, philosophy, theories about the natural world, cultural prejudice, and religious belief. in particular, we will consider how greek, roman, chinese, indian, islamicate, and early european theories of human difference shaped justifications for conquest as, gender roles and sexuality, often in surprising ways. questions we will ask include: how did medieval people differentiate humans from animals? did they use the same categories of race, gender, and sexuality that we use? how did scientific thinking evolve to construct these taxonomies of difference? how were ideas shared cross-culturally? to explore these questions, we will read primary texts in translation from the medieval period. through our discussions, we will consider not only what other approaches to defining human differences can teach us, but how they provide historical insight into frameworks and assumptions about diversity today.

usna,289b,everyday toxic chemicals,3,"each of us uses hundreds of chemicals every day.  while many of these chemicals are designed to make our products safer, cheaper, more convenient to use, and more effective, they can also present risks to ourselves and to the environment. certainly, there are times when the benefits of using toxic chemicals outweigh the risk. for example, if you were on a ship that had caught fire, you would probably want to use the best possible firefighting foam, even if it were toxic. on the other hand, if you were choosing which microwave popcorn to buy, you might choose the one that did not use a cancer-causing chemical on the bags, even though it made them less grease-proof. how do we determine whether a chemical is toxic? who decides when the risks outweigh the benefits? in this seminar, we will analyze the lifecycle of everyday products such as food packaging and shampoo, tracing their path from production, to use, to final place in the environment. we will also examine methods to evaluate the risk chemicals present to ourselves and to wildlife, and how these evaluation paradigms inform regulations.

usna,289c,gender and technology,3,"technology has become an essential part of our daily life--the way we experience the world and think about it--and, as such, is also central to how we understand our identities and status. this seminar will explore the ways in which gender and technology define and redefine each other, considering both how gender shapes technology and the technological professions, and how technology itself produces ideas and practices of gender and sexuality. while the course will focus on gender and sexuality, we will also examine how they intersect with other categories such as class, race, and ethnicity. how does technology offer possibilities for new social relations? what role have women played in the development of technology? how does technology both challenge and maintain gender, race, and class hierarchies? how does technology shape our understanding of sexuality and gender roles? why are there so few women in stem? what is the impact of feminism on technological innovations and can we create a feminist technology? the course will examine these questions through a focus on three thematic units: gender of technology, gender in technology, and the technology of gender, looking at historical and contemporary developments from the nineteenth century to the present.

usna,289d,the practice of environmental justice,3,"more than 50 years ago, rachel carson published her groundbreaking work silent spring, which helped to sound the alarm about the dangers of using certain kinds of petrochemical pesticides on our farms, gardens, and public lands. she showed that the physical environment, far from being a pristine wilderness isolated from human activity, is actually a sphere we need to monitor with care. if we fail to do so, we risk poisoning ourselves.  in this class, we use carson as an introduction to the field of environmental justice, defined as the convergence of social justice and environmental movements. environmental justice exists today in three broad areas: social and political activism in local and international communities; legal and policy structures and initiatives; and academic contributions across many disciplines. students will read articles from these perspectives, and we will encounter difficult ethical problems, including the fact that poor and minority communities are disproportionately exposed to toxic sites. students will collaborate with peers in researching an environmental justice site or problem, and everyone will produce an independently written and researched argument that makes a specific proposal for change. we will use the environment of cleveland and northeast ohio as our starting point for studying pollution, recovery, and the many ways that environmental justice might help communities to thrive.

usna,289e,medieval robots,3,"the medieval world had robots. some were housed in medieval churches where altarpieces with angels could move, ascending and descending during celebrations. others appeared in travel narratives like those of marco polo. during his visit to the mongols, the merchant and explorer described gold peacocks whose wings flapped and mechanical drinking fountains. still others are detailed in literature. authors of romances have arthur's knights fighting automaton warriors to gain entry into castles and receiving gifts like teleporting brass horses. while machines in the medieval period were not as ubiquitous as they are in our modern lives, they posed many of the same questions and concerns that we have about our own technology. writers frequently incorporated robots into travel narratives and poetry to identify exotic or foreign cultures, and such details can tell us much about racial and political identity in the period. further, automatons and machines could be used as examples of dangerous luxury or viewed as marvels of engineering that challenged the boundaries between what was created by human hands and by god. this class will use a variety of texts and artifacts--medieval literature, blueprints, and art alongside current writings about the ethics of ai--to think about the role of machines in the medieval world and in our own modern lives. in addition to talking and writing about examples of medieval machines and technology, students will also build their own machines using think[box].

usna,289n,the mind's essential tension,3,"the idea that the mind is fundamentally divided has been around from ancient to modern times. sometimes this division is explicitly claimed to be a critical feature of human nature; other times it is expressed as different ways of being-in or experiencing the world; in yet other cases the focus is on contrasting domains that the mind either apprehends or creates. examples include: yin vs. yang, spiritual vs material, numinous vs. mundane, masculine vs. feminine, mind vs. body/matter, theoretical vs. practical reason, science vs. arts/humanities, reason vs. passion, normative vs descriptive, fact vs. value, poetry vs. prose, to have vs. to be, doing vs. being, left brain vs. right brain, empathizing vs. systemizing, thinking fast vs. slow.
there can be no doubt that the notion of a divided mind has proven intuitively appealing to many. however, to what degree is such an idea supported by careful and rigorous scholarship? each of the claimed divisions listed above has been critiqued, often ferociously and with good reason. however, there is also a compelling case to be made for the presence of a division. strong examples come from numerous disciplines: from philosophy, work on ethics and aesthetics, in the continental tradition, and on the problems of consciousness and free will; from psychology, work on decision making (prospect theory) and thinking styles; from neuroscience, work on the network structure of the brain.
in this class, we will be focused on asking the following questions: is there a fundamental division in the mind? if so, what is the nature of the division? why is it helpful to claim a division--what work does it do? how is it unhelpful? to what degree are apparent divisions products of culture and context, vs. biology? how might a scientific account of the division transform our understanding of historically influential divisions? how might historical and/or philosophical work inform current scientific research?

usso,271,schoolhouse rocked: education reform,3,"today, the term ""education reform"" may bring to mind standardized tests and no child left behind. many believe that our schools must become more rigorous, with stricter rules and definable goals. ""reform,"" however, used to be defined differently. john dewey, maria montessori, and paulo-freire, for example, struggled to make schools freer and more humane. they hoped not to make the classroom less challenging, but more child-centered. some disciples of such reformers, discouraged by schools' resistance to change, eventually turned to homeschooling--pulling kids out of school and educating them with real-life learning experiences. in this seminar, we will explore progressive educational theory and connect it with contemporary alternative schools and homeschooling. visits to nearby montessori and waldorf schools and discussions with homeschoolers will make real-life connections to seminar reading and classwork. challenging assumptions about how well our schools work and raising questions such as, ""how do we learn?"" and ""what is good teaching?"" will provoke thought, conversation, and interesting writing.

usso,285i,spectacle in american culture,3,"this seminar will examine the topic of spectacle both chronologically and typologically to better u understand the power of remarkable visual experiences to awe, entertain, persuade, and create meaning from the colonial period to the present day.  in the 17th century, the religious beliefs of the new england community and its need to maintain social cohesiveness gave rise to the spectacle of witch trials and public punishments. as americans moved westward, the natural world became the focus of the spectacular.  in the nineteenth century, the campaigns and debates of presidential candidates became political theater.  the latter half of the century gave rise to consumption as spectacle as exemplified in the may expositions and world's fairs.  today, spectacle has reached all facets of our lives.  americans are willing to expose the most intimate details of their personal relationships on television shows like jerry springer and the real world.  although frequently used to maintain power, spectacle also has been employed as a tactic of resistance and as an instrument for creating alternative meaning by subcultures. more recently, spectacle has served as an instrument of terror. through lectures, discussion, multimedia presentations, and writing assignments, we will have an opportunity to reflect on the many forms and uses of spectacle in american history.

in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, we are witnessing the ""flattening"" of the world due to the technological revolution, a phenomenon brought about by the instant and worldwide generation of and access to information.  two major consequences of this evolution are: a) individuals are more empowered than at any time in history and the traditional societal structure is under constant challenge; b) companies have changed their business structures and practices and have begun to operate on a truly global scale.

usso,287t,"gender, visibility and performance: the courtesan",3,"throughout history, the figure of the courtesan has embodied seduction, performance, and mystery; occupying the private spaces of the real and the imaginary across cultures.  the impact of the courtesan on society can be seen in travelogues, poetry, and historical treatises, as well as in texts written specifically about courtesans themselves.  those cultures which had a courtesan class frequently experienced varying degrees of social discomfort.  within the culture, there was tension between those who patronized courtesans and those who considered them a social menace.  from without, cultures which had courtesans were believed to be either excessively decadent or highly civilized, depending on the cultural standpoint of the observer.  
in this seminar, we will study real courtesans as well as examine the figure of the courtesan within the context of literature, religion, music history, and gender theory.  the seminar will begin with an overview of the origins of the courtesan, focused on the roles of women and slave musicians in the court and temple in egypt, india, greece, and mesopotamia starting in 3,000 bce.  then, we will explore factors leading to the development of a courtesan class and compare the roles of courtesans and their place in their culture in europe, india, asia, and the middle east.  readings and class discussion will encompass issues relating to the impact of gender on performance, literary genres, education, and social and legal status, as well as continuing questions related to translation of primary sources, colonialism, and religious movements.  in addition to the readings, we will also study images of the courtesan from antiquity to the present, listen to music by and about courtesans, sample some of their writing, and watch films about ""real"" courtesans.  the primary goal is not only to look at the impact of courtesans in history, but also to engage issues related to gender and performance from a variety of different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

in this seminar, we will use a chronological framework to examine the institution of slavery, uses for slaves, methodologies and sources for studying slavery and the slave trade in world history. beginning with slavery in the ancient near east, egypt, greece and rome, the class will include slavery and the feudal system in medieval europe, indentured servitude and concubinage, slaves in the early islamic courts, the ottoman slave trade, the african slave trade and slavery in the americas, and the current problem of human trafficking. within each section, students will read primary texts and recent scholarship examining the social, economic and religious rationales behind slavery. we will also study different methodologies and the impact of gender, race and social class on the study of world slavery. as many slaver cultures had different definitions for what it meant to be a slave, we will address questions related to translation, interpretation and perception when dealing with primary sources. the primary goal of the course is to provide a broader context for the institution of slavery in world history as a means not only to understand the impact of slavery has had on american culture, but on other cultures as well.

the goals of the course include: exploring the relationship between form and content in written and visual productions, developing a critical perspective from which to enjoy, assess, and respond creatively to traditional print and multimedia presentations, and making excellent use of research resources at cwru and cultural resources at university circle. in addition, students will work to develop their writing and presentation skills and to innovate novel models of research writing.

ussy,288j,cultural representations of violence,3,"the twentieth century was arguably the most violent in human history.  that legacy has carried into our own time: from 9/11 to school shootings to the recent conflict in libya, violence surrounds us.  but what exactly is violence?  how is it that we all recognize it when we see it?  how do we represent it to ourselves?  most importantly, how do we make sense of it?  can we make sense of it?  this class will explore these questions by studying the uneasy role violence plays in literature, film, performance art, and other cultural productions.  as we do so, we will consider two central and potentially conflicting ideas.  on the one hand, violence tends to resist our abilities to represent it; any depiction seems somehow inadequate to the real thing.  at the same time, representations of violence surround us constantly, and for any number of political, cultural, and social reasons.  thus, violence in modern and contemporary culture is paradoxical, both permeating and resisting our imaginations.  through class discussions, written responses, presentations, and independent research projects, we will explore these and other ideas, considering how art attempts to comprehend violence and how artistic representations of violence relate to (implicate?) their audience.  although our focus will be largely on art, and primarily literature, our approach will be necessarily interdisciplinary.  be prepared to weigh in on topics as diverse as politics, aesthetics, philosophy, gender and sexuality, war, trauma, and colonialism.  undoubtedly, violence can be a painful subject, but the goal of our seminar is to pursue a rigorous intellectual and imaginative inquiry into one of the most pressing topics of our time.

ussy,288v,"seclusion, gender and the exotic: imagining the harem",3,"when the term ""harem"" is invoked, the first image that comes to mind is of scantily clad women living in sequestered opulence in some exotic, yet vaguely ""eastern"" place. this image has been reproduced and perpetuated through art, literature and music to the degree that even today, familiar themes of seduction, passivity and mystery related to the harem can be found throughout popular culture.

historically, gender segregation reaches into antiquity and existed in a variety of forms, cross-culturally. the term ""harem"" was not used regularly until the 13th century, and then only referred to the specific form of gender segregation used by the ottoman court. application of the word ""harem"" to all women's quarters in other cultures was the result of european contact with the ottoman empire, despite the fact that other cultures often had their own, distinct, terminology for women's spaces.

in this seminar, we will explore the history and practice of gender segregation as a means to examine how the idea of the harem was constructed in the eastern and western imagination. under what circumstances did women live separately? how were gendered spaces created, justified and maintained? where did our image of the harem come from? using primary and secondary sources, we will examine a selection of histories and representations of the harem in literature, slave and travel narratives, and religion. as the western idea of the harem is part of what edward said theorized as ""orientalism"", we will explore said's theory as well as subsequent theories related to gender and the exotic. in addition, we will look at images of women's quarters from antiquity to the present and listen to representations of the exotic in music. our goal is not only to study the historical fact of the harem, but also to engage issues related to gender, the exotic and representation from different disciplinary and cultural points of view.

ussy,288y,shots in the dark: investigating crime films,3,"crime movies and their subgenres (gangster, film noir, detective, police) are the most enduringly popular of all hollywood genres.  they've been around since the silent era and attest to america's fascination with crime.  but another reason we are so attracted to crime films stems from a pair of contradictory narrative projects that underline the genre.  on the one hand, these films valorize the distinctions between the genre's stock characters--criminal, victim and avenger--in order to affirm the social, moral or institutional order.  on the other hand, crime movies explore the relations between the three roles in order to mount a critique that challenges that order.  in addition to emphasizing film studies, we will study the films for what they say about crime, criminals and criminal law.

as most crime films contain an investigation, so too will the organization of the course.  there are methods for analyzing film just as there are methods for investigating a crime scene.  investigation requires identifying, collecting, analyzing and interpreting evidence.  we'll start by investigating what makes the genre so enduring--its mise-en-scene, intent or characters?  you will be reporting your findings in three scholarly papers: a formal analysis on a specific film, a sociological analysis of a specific film and a research paper with documentation.

ussy,289a,do we have free will?,3,"concepts such as freedom, choice, moral responsibility, and autonomy are commonly invoked to describe our sense, as human beings, that our actions and thoughts are really our own. this seems like experiential commonsense-when i choose to read a novel instead of a philosophy text it feels like the decision to do so was made by me, that there was no coercion, or other seen or unseen force, that intervened to make me choose as i did. we extend this logic to the judgment of moral and legal responsibility. if you engage in good behavior, you get the praise; if you do bad things, you are blameworthy.

 despite our self-perception that we freely make decisions and choose our actions, we sometimes invoke the notion that certain events are the result of some prior cause or circumstance that determines what occurs in the present. in this instance, we do not appear to be fully free in our choices because we cannot undo the causes that dictate what is taking place here and now. to the extent that we experience current actions as having a cause in the past, we are flirting with the idea that our behavior is not wholly free, but determined or conditioned by what has come before. determinism, necessity, fate, destiny, predestination: these are terms typically used to describe the sense that our actions and thoughts are the result of unknown forces or circumstances beyond our control.

 this course uses classic and contemporary texts, taken from multiple cultural traditions, to explore the problem of free will and related issues of body/mind dualism and personal identity. although the term ""free will"" does not appear in all cultural contexts, found everywhere are questions of whether we are free to act and think as we wish or whether our thoughts and actions are in some way determined. we also read science fiction short stories as thought experiments in order to help us understand the ramifications of various positions on free will and related problems.

 this course is discussion-based and writing-intensive. classes focus on analysis and interpretation of texts and ideas.

ussy,289e,poets of ohio,3,"more often than not, contemporary society views poetry as a strange and dated art form. when the genre actually does receive recognition, it is usually under the guise of hip-hop or slam poetry. while both of those offshoots contain their own poetic and artistic merit, this course intends to familiarize you with contemporary, literary poetry and highlight the dynamic poetry community of ohio. luckily for us, many of the poets we will read during the course agreed to visit our class this semester to talk about their work and read their poems.
in addition to demonstrating that poetry is alive, well, and thriving all around us, we will also attempt to think critically about this genre. why do poetic texts, both of the present and the past, seem so difficult to read and understand? what writing techniques, strategies, and styles do poets use that make comprehending their work such a challenge? more importantly, why would anyone choose to write in this manner? through close readings of the primary texts, researching the historical and literary contexts surrounding contemporary poetry, and discussing the art form with each other (as well as with the poets themselves), we will come to a better understanding of how these texts function.
to this extent, our course will engage the symbolic world as we explore the local and national poetry communities, noting how writers found relationships upon geography, aesthetics, and demographics (just to name a few), using written texts to express some emotion, thought, or identity. in order to accomplish these goals, we will read, participate in class discussions, and write extensively about poetry composed by contemporary ohio poets. therefore, you will be expected to engage our course texts critically, thinking through the manner in which language operates as a tool for generating and sustaining, as well as undermining, community formation.

ussy,289i,the art of science,3,"this is an interdisciplinary course that will explore the intersection between two disparate but often-connected fields, the history of art and the history of science.  although these fields are separated on college campuses today, they share a history that is united by a common philosophical question: how do we evaluate and know the world around us?  the documentation of that knowledge is often visual--whether written or painted, tabulated or carved--images play an essential role in the shaping and recording of information. beginning with the renaissance revival of pliny's natural history (c. 77-79 bce) this class will focus on the complex ways in which science and art overlap and enrich one another. topics explored in this course include: mathematical theory and linear perspective; anatomical dissection and naturalism in figure painting; optics, lenses, and realism; copernicus, galileo and religious painting; botany and scientific illustration; natural history and fine art collecting, etc. classes will be supplemented by visits to the museum of natural history, the cleveland museum of art, and the dittrick museum of medical history.

ussy,289j,beauty myths today,3,"published just over 20 years ago, naomi wolf's influential study ""the beauty myth"" significantly influenced popular thinking about body image.  analyzing both cultural trends and empirical data, wolf argued that as women made unprecedented advances in public life in the latter half of the 20th century, they were at the same time held to increasingly unrealistic standards of physical beauty.  wolf's study not only contributed to extant analyses of sexism in the media, but also introduced to mainstream readers the politics of the representation of women's bodies in popular culture.  this course will examine to what extent wolf's original claim hold true today.  in other words, what physical standards must one meet in order to be considered professionally and personally successful?  in exploring this question, we will look at the origins and current workings of the american beauty industry, considering the changing representation of the ideal body throughout the 20th century.  we'll read texts by historians, philosophers, novelists, poets, cultural critics, and journalists who examine the politics of beauty. to both (re-)define and trace the continuing effects of beauty myths in the 21st century, we'll consider the rhetoric of ideal womanhood as it shows up in popular texts such as websites promoting anorexia, tv shows about plastic surgery, diet books, magazines, and guides for mothers.  students will have opportunities to define the beauty myth more broadly, exploring its effects on men and its mediating presence in other cultural sites.

ussy,291b,science (fiction) dystopias,3,"in 1927 the german science fiction classic metropolis showed filmgoers a mechanized dystopian nightmare in which humans took on the roles of cogs and levers in a giant machine. years later, george orwell's nineteen eighty-four depicted a totalitarian regime reshaping post-war england in a similar way, using surveillance and repetitive activities to turn the population into something less than human. appropriating science fiction motifs, dystopian narratives have forced us to reconsider how science and technology are used to complicate and at times augment our notion of what it means to be a social animal. in this class, we will consider a range of texts, including novels, short stories, films, and comic books, to explore the interaction between people and the things that they invent. the first half of the course will emphasize traditional utopian texts and readings will include selections from works like margaret cavendish's blazing world (biological utopia), yevgeny zamyatin's we (mathematical dystopia), and george orwell's nineteen eighty-four (technological dystopia). during the second half of the semester we will discuss utopian and dystopian worlds in popular fiction and film, such as science fiction short stories by harlan ellison, alan moore's v for vendetta, and wall-e, to consider how the utopia/dystopia changed in the latter half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century.

in this interdisciplinary course we'll investigate the birth of both money and the idea of its badness. we'll survey history, literature, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, film, and the day's news for culturally varied expressions of, and reactions to, this suspicion. we'll first ask, ""what is money?"" (""how do things like rocks, metals, shells, or data-bits become, and continue to be, money?"") and ""what is morality?"" (""what might we mean when we claim some act, person, situation, or system is morally better or worse?""). we'll then consider specific suspicions and morally evaluate them, along the way raising questions such as: why can i rent myself out as a landscaper but not as a prostitute? is the iranian kidney market better than u.s. waiting lists, or ""bio-violence?"" should americans with slave ancestors be paid for their family past? is there a moral difference between a corporate raider and a pirate? what is aristotle's explanation for why capitalists often produce crap? why might nietzsche think wall street's gordon gekko might be right that ""greed is good?? what does marx mean when he claims money-driven markets are ""alienating?"" if money expresses our values, ought anything be above money? is anything beyond price?

in this seminar we will consider a number of major plays and musicals produced on and off broadway since the year 2000. among the questions to be considered over the course of the semester: what does it mean to create and experience theater in the context of emerging technologies?  has theater continued to evolve to address the changing needs and sensibilities of 21st century audiences?  in what ways does it provide a voice to marginalized social groups?

this seminar invites students to investigate the secret lives of animals as imagined in a sampling of classical, medieval and modern literatures. thinking with animals past and present--in fables, manuals, and tales--we will examine human-animal relationships in imagined settings. over the course of the semester, we will read, view, listen, and perform works in which animals are tasked with teaching moral lessons and testing the ethical obligations of their human audiences. comparing treatments of companion animals past and present, we will reflect on the many ways literature can guide our evolving relationship to the animal kingdom.

ussy,292s,the meaning of life: a novel idea,3,"according to the critic walter benjamin, while short stories can convey a moral, ""the 'meaning of life' is really the center about which the novel moves."" many critics share this view, arguing that the very idea of ""the meaning of life"" emerges alongside of the novel genre because of the ways novels portray individuals thinking about their lives. novels characters internally reflect, make choices, and interact with others--often over long periods of time and through many changing circumstances. furthermore, they depict how characters--personal choices--are influenced by a variety of external, social forces. in doing so, novels have offered their readers ways to think about what they value, and why. 

this seminar will take up the novel genre as a way to think carefully and deeply about just what the idea of ""the meaning of life"" involves. we will discuss how various novels have addressed--and continue to address--the desire for fulfillment and purpose. we will begin by examining how it came to be that novels came to be associated with and helped create the very concept of the ""meaning of life."" then we read some classic novels to examine how the novel has portrayed the meaning of life. we will conclude the course with a contemporary novel and ask whether or not contemporary novels are creating experiences of meaning in the same way they did hundreds of years ago. if they are, is that meaning still the same? if not, are novels asking different kinds of big questions? is ""the meaning of life"" not as vital as it used to be to how novels work? in addressing these questions we will strive to understand the history of this literary form, its uses for our own personal introspection and ethical thinking, as well as the continuing role of novels in our rapidly evolving society.

ussy,293c,"the state, legitimacy, and insurgency",3,"this seminar investigates why individuals organize themselves into a political state, as well as what happens when they decide a state no longer has legitimate power over them. what responsibilities does a state have, if it is to maintain its authority? under what conditions can a state lose its legitimacy? when do individuals have a moral responsibility to resist state power? what forms can such resistance take and still be considered moral? in undertaking these questions, we will read a wide range of texts from different disciplines, periods of history, parts of the world, and cultural and religious backgrounds.  the final project will require you to articulate a careful and morally consistent `insurgency in which (i) the form of resistance is appropriate to the nature and degree of the state's failures, and (ii) the moral justification for the `insurgency does not violate the moral reasoning that justified resistance in the first place.

ussy,293h,the landscape of memory,3,"""never forget"" has become an important command of the twentieth century. for survivors of the worst atrocities in recent history, remembering is seen as both a moral and political duty. but how should the memory of these mass traumas be carried forward in the public sphere? and what forms of commemoration are the most effective, accurate, or enduring? in this course, we will examine the remembering of trauma in a range of public ""memory sites,"" including oral testimonies, published memoirs, monuments, museums, and films. we will also consider postmodern forms of ""counter-memory"" in contemporary photography and conceptual art. while we will discuss a range of ""memory sites,"" we will focus primarily on those that reflect on the holocaust and 9/11. we will examine how and why different memorial practices have evolved, and reflect on the value of passing on such horrific memories to future generations. we'll also discuss how the process of remembering alters the meaning of traumatic events. as a culminating project, students will analyze a memorial site or institution, using existing scholarship to investigate the creation of the site, its sources of funding, its design process, and the controversies it created.

ussy,293n,global shakespeares,3,"the british playwright ben jonson famously eulogized his friend and competitor william shakespeare by saying, ""...he was not of an age but for all time."" recently, however, scholars and theater practitioners have been far more engaged with the question of whether shakespeare is for all nations. in this course, we will consider what it means to read shakespeare globally. shakespeare wrote his plays during the first era of british colonial expansion; today, we read those same plays during a supposedly ""post-colonial"" era. accordingly, we will ask two related but possibly opposing questions: what did shakespeare think of the world?  and what does the world think about shakespeare? in order to answer these questions, we will read three plays in which shakespeare directly engages issues of cultural difference and empire alongside contemporary adaptations of those plays from asia, africa, and the caribbean. how aware was shakespeare of the specific cultural identities of the mediterranean or the ""new world?"" conversely, is a work ""still"" shakespeare when it has been translated into a different cultural setting? in addition to gaining a finer understanding of shakespeare's work and its historical context, we will examine how and why shakespeare's drama can be repurposed in different political and national contexts today.

ussy,293p,music in time and place: a window into the development of american identity,3,"although american symphonic music grew out of the western european tradition, it also developed distinct characteristics. composers marveled at the qualities and character of the young nation, especially the vastness and beauty of its land. an aesthetic sense of the land influenced artists as they sought to capture their perspectives of time and space, as well as the american people themselves, and the role they played in those perspectives. in this course, we will examine a series of symphonic works that specifically reference geographical place in their titles. through this study we will gain insight into the development of american cultural identity and how the focus of musical works shifted from rural to urban life. to enhance our understanding, we will consider the historical context of these american symphonic works, as well as related works of art.

pqhs,550,meta-analysis & evidence synthesis,2 - 3,"systematic reviews use reproducible methods to systematically search the literature and synthesize the results of a specific topic area. meta-analysis is a specific analytic technique used to pool results of individual studies. systematic reviews are useful ways to establish one's knowledge in a particular field of study, and can highlight gaps in research which can be pursued in future work. they can also inform the background of a grant. 

this course is designed to introduce students to the methods of conducting a high quality systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies. we will cover the design, methods, and analytic techniques involved in systematic reviews. these concepts will prepare students to conduct their own systematic review or evaluate the systematic reviews of others. sessions will be lectures, labs, and presentations.  

topics include developing a search strategy, abstracting key data, synthesizing the results qualitatively, meta-analytic techniques, grading the quality of studies, grading the strength of the evidence, and manuscript preparation specific to systematic reviews and meta-analysis of intervention studies.  

caveat:
if you would like to conduct a systematic review of your own that can be published after the course ends, you will need to have several other class members or colleagues willing to work with you on the project. the systematic review should be on a topic where you expect no more than 20-30 included studies in order to be able to complete the review soon after the course ends.

the primarily aim of this course is to introduce an image of jesus little known outside the arabic islamic culture. it is an image that might be of interest to those who wish to understand how jesus was perceived by a religious tradition which greatly revered him but rejected his divinity. hence, the jesus presented in this course will be similar in some ways to the jesus in the christian gospels, in others not. why and how this muslim tradition of jesus arose will be also discussed in this course.  jesus through islamic lens will draw from various islamic texts to provide a comprehensive selection of excerpts pertaining to the life and moral teachings of jesus. approaching christ from an islamic perspective, this course will offer the students a rare opportunity to understand the significance of jesus in islam  and to gain a better understanding of the faith, not only as it contrasts with christianity but also as it compares. 

in this course we will try to respond to these questions: what role does jesus have in islam?  what does the quran say about him? what does it not say?  why are muslims repulsed by the idea that jesus is the son of god, fully god and fully man?  what do muslims have in mind when they acknowledge jesus as virgin-born?

msfi,493,blockchains and ai: applications in finance and business,3,"it behooves today's business leaders to be well acquainted with blockchain technologies and ai (artificial intelligence), two seemingly disparate technologies that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt a wide range of businesses.
the popularity of blockchain technologies has increased exponentially since the release of bitcoin in 2009. while bitcoins garnered a lot of attention during the initial days, the focus has shifted over time to the underlying technology: blockchain. this wildly innovative technology has made possible tasks that were hitherto deemed implausible: validate ownership in a digital asset, verify the true state of a transaction without relying on a costly intermediary etc. the list of businesses that are impacted by this technology makes for an impressive reading: supply chain, health care, insurance, foreign exchange transfers, real estate, etc.
if the emphasis of blockchain technology is on trust, that of artificial intelligence is on predictions. accurate predictions and sound judgements are two critical ingredients of any decision making process. while the jury is still out on whether algorithms can make sound judgements, recent developments in a field called machine learning (and its sub-field, deep learning) have led to dramatic improvements in the accuracy of predictions made by these algorithms. significantly, this gain in accuracy has been accompanied by a reduction in overall costs. these in turn have spurred the recent interest in ai. organizations that have enabled ai at the enterprise level appear to be making more informed decisions and innovating new products. 
in this course, we will unpack these technologies and examine a wide range of relevant business use cases. our objective is to provide a practical introduction to these key technologies and their business implications. we focus on business perspectives, rather than on the technical dimensions. fittingly, this course is open to all graduate students of weatherhead school (mba and all specialty masters). students are not expected to have any specific programming background; however, a basic understanding of statistics is required to better appreciate the discourse on artificial intelligence.

iime,473,fundamentals of clinical information systems,3,"technology has played a significant role in the evolution of medical science and treatment.  while we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  this introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (cis).  often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the ""art"" of cis more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  in this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (a) operational and strategic information needs, (b) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (c) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.  legal and ethical issues are explored.  the student learns the process of ""plan, design, implement"" through hands-on applications to select cis problems, while at the same time gaining insights and understanding of the impacts placed on patients and health care providers.

fsna,134,fuel cells,4,"fuel cells convert hydrogen and other fuels directly to electricity and are viewed as a key technology for non-polluting, oil-independent energy in the future.  in this course, we will study and critically analyze the prospects, technical and economic barriers, and impact of broad implementation of fuel cells, focusing on the transportation sector and portable power.  major topics of the course include: (i) world and us energy outlook; (ii) potential role and impact of fuel-cells; their advantages, principles of operation, design and materials issues, limitations and prospects for improvements; (iii) special focus on details of a polymer type fuel cells (pemfcs) for transportation and portable power; (iv) modeling fuel cell performance and evaluation of controlling mechanisms that limit performance.  the course is designed for students from all disciplines.  students will be expected to read assigned texts and articles and critically analyze statements and points of view presented.  quantitative analysis will be encouraged and developed.  student teams will develop a hypothesis to improve fuel cell performance by modifying the design of a component of the fuel cell.  the new component design with then be fabricated and tested in an operating prototype fuel cell.  data analysis, hypothesis conclusion, and reporting of results are expected."
fsna,135,biodesign basics: the art of finding patient needs,4,"biodesign basics explores the art of finding patient needs. no prior clinical or medical education is required, as we focus on acquiring and refining the underpinning critical thinking skills needed to identify and articulate unmet clinical patient needs in contemporary healthcare settings. many--if not a majority of--ideas leading to healthcare innovation are derived from issues that arise during the daily activities of caring for patients. whether it is frustration with the use of a specific surgical instrument, processes that interfere with health care delivery, better waiting rooms for the family, designing more comfortable hospital gowns, or materials inadequate for intended outcomes, patient needs cover a broad range of physical and emotional states. many students find the idea of identifying a ""patient need"" quite ambiguous at first, but the biodesign process for defining patient need is a widely use national model developed at stanford university that the student will find contains easy-to-follow steps that are simple and appealing.
as an interactive and ""hands-on"" course, students will be engaged in discussions, events and activities to promote a first-hand understanding of ""needs finding"" to support individual mastery of writing and oral presentation skills. the fourth hour will be centered on ""walking tours"" of local medical institutions around university circle as well as actual use of medical devices (wheelchairs and crutches) on campus as ways to help your efforts identify a patient need based on those observations. in short, you will create your own experiences leading to stories that make writing fun. the course requires students to engage in written and oral communications as well as working in small teams to complete open-ended assignments."
fsna,136,"saving the world from poverty, disease, injustice and environmental exploitation",4,"half of the world's population lives in poverty.  the causes of poverty and injustice are complex and the ramifications are numerous and serious and include grave risk to human health and to the environment.  through reading, analysis, writing, and rigorous discussion the class will investigate issues surrounding poverty and disparities in health and opportunity.  we will also explore how innovation and engineering design can help address causes of poverty and disparity and meet needs of people at risk.  design teams will work throughout the semester to identify an unmet need to engineer a solution to benefit an under-served or under-resourced population.  fourth-hour activities will include interviewing knowledgeable stakeholders (locally and abroad via teleconference), learning about and volunteering with service organizations, and visiting local institutions and/or companies addressing these issues."
fsna,138,light,4,"this course explores light, otherwise known as visible electromagnetic radiation.  we will examine what light is in its various forms; how it is created and detected; how we perceive it; and how it has influenced our evolutionary development, our technological, artistic, and religious cultures, and our conceptions of space and time.  students will discuss topics suggested by the course readings and by exposure to the many scientific activities, historical artifacts, and artistic works on the cwru campus and at other local institutions that involve light in a significant way."
fsna,144,is mind what the brain does?,4,"together we will explore the nature of the human mind by asking the question, ""is the mind what the brain does?""  through an exploration of neurological and psychological case studies, empirical research studies, direct experimentation, and readings and films about brain structure and function, we will form hypotheses about the relationship between the mind and the brain and gather evidence to test our hypotheses.  writing assignments will explore ideas about your own mind and brain, examples of other individuals with unusual or atypical brains and minds, and a research topic of your choice."
fsna,145,hostile water,4,"water is an essential, valuable resource that is protected by a wide variety of social, legal, and technical institutions.  however, not all water is desirable. hostile water is unwanted water from which we seek to protect ourselves. hostile waters challenge our understanding of the natural world and the social doctrine upon which our understanding is based. this course will examine how historical ""hostile water"" events have altered our social perceptions and legal institutions, led to structural flood control, ""damn"" engineering, the national flood insurance program, landsat satellites, ""wild rivers,"" fema, wetlands preservation, detention basins, etc., and to homeowner stormwater management options such as rain barrels and rain gardens. the course will begin with a review of the original documentation and modern interpretation of the johnstown flood. students will then conduct research on historical events and prepare written briefing documents and oral presentations focusing on the physical impacts and social consequences of dramatic hostile water events. the course will end with a critical review of the hurricane katrina event. class discussions will examine how hostile water events have impacted u.s. policies and institutions, and appears to be leading to stormwater management obligations for individual homeowners."
fsna,148,science or pseudoscience? exploring extraordinary claims,4,"in the contemporary world, extraordinary claims about ghosts, aliens, and the nature of the universe appear on popular television shows, on the internet, and in the press.  many of these claims are framed as science.  in this seminar, we critically examine the nature of these understandings of the world around us.  we will ask if these claims are scientific and, if not, whether they constitute a form of pseudoscience.  we will explore the role of demarcation, evidence, scientific progress, and fallacies of reasoning in pseudoscience.  we will also consider the historical and sociocultural currents that give rise to these pseudoscientific claims as well as their social and political implications.  drawing on anthropological, philosophical, and historical case studies, we will consider topics such as cryptozoology, astrology, ancient aliens, parapsychology, the nemesis theory of dinosaur extinctions, theories of intelligence, and other extraordinary claims."
fsna,150,hobbies - engineering fun,4,"this seminar introduces students to the idea that engineering can be found in all sorts of unexpected places, even in our hobbies.  to test our hypothesis, we will examine the hobbies enjoyed by the course instructors:  baseball and building synthetic coral reef aquariums.  students will then work under the instructors' guidance to analyze how principles of engineering can be used to understand the successes and failures they have encountered in their own hobbies, with the ultimate goal of developing a proposal for improving their experience of these hobbies."
fsna,154,the green energy transformation in germany,4,"this seminar introduces students to the development and successes of green technologies in germany.  we will examine the proactive development of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies, commonly referred to as energiewende, that was started by the german green movement and promoted by germany's innovative renewable energy policies.  we will consider such questions as: what are the implications of this german success story, both for the us and the rest of the world?  what lessons can be applied to other situations?  what factors might limit the utility of those lessons?  in the process of our investigation, we will examine such important issues as globalization, resource finiteness, and sustainability challenges, including economic crises, climate change, energy insecurity, and global competition."
fsna,157,plastics recycling: re-use of plastic waste,4,"about 300 million tons of plastics are produced globally each year, but only about 10 percent of these products are recycled, despite the fact that recycling uses significantly less energy and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than does manufacture of the virgin materials. this course will address the scientific, economic, environmental, and political issues involved in plastics recycling. following an introduction to the chemical structures and properties of commodity plastics, we will discuss the actual recycling of plastics in municipal waste including the problems faced in collection and sorting of plastic waste and recycling economics. then we will address the commercial applications and properties of recycled plastics and why they generally have inferior properties to virgin materials, which significantly reduces their market value. finally we will look at biodegradable alternatives to oil-based materials as  well as some options to plastics recycling, including land filling, burning for power generation, and monomer reclamation."
fsna,158,what is making and manufacturing today and why is innovation part of the story?,4,"the rise of the creative class into the world of ""making"" has resulted in new economic models, new definitions of manufacturing, and new ways of working.  ""making"" is inclusive of a wide variety of activities, from the arts and crafts, to woodworking, to high technology integrating with traditional craftsmanship, to products with embedded sensors in traditional materials, to the use of 3d printing of everything from polymers to metals to chocolate. within all of these approaches, ""innovation"" is often the buzzword, the common denominator.  what does innovation mean in this context?  are innovators and makers today any different from the innovators and manufacturers of the past?  what role does science and math have in making and manufacturing?  through both a hands-on and historical approach, we will explore the commonalities between today's makers and yesterday's manufacturers, and arrive at an understanding of innovation and apply this understanding to a project that could continue throughout your time at cwru."
fsna,159,nanotechnology in medicine: the fantastic voyage,4,"this course is a freshman seminar designed to introduce students to nanoscience and nanotechnology, their application in the world of biomedicine, and the fundamental science and engineering principles that guide the current state-of-art and future approaches. the course will begin with an introduction to the history, science and terminology of `nano scale', `nanotechnology' and `nanomedicine'. it will then focus on the historical advancements in the field and describe why and how the field became an exciting component of medical technologies. the course will draw on a variety of texts including book sections, newspaper articles, editorials, scientific journal  articles and internet-sourced information to understand the realm of nanoscience and nanotechnology in various stem areas and their specific application in biomedicine. the course will also correlate science fiction with reality, pertaining to the nanomedicine area, via two classic movies: fantastic voyage (1966) and inner space (1987). the students will be asked to interpret components/sections of the movies in terms of `conceptual correctness', `scientific correctness' and `challenges in nanomedicine'."
fsna,160,technological development and popular perception,4,"the central theme of this seminar is the basic functioning of engineered devices and systems.  the devices/systems covered will be 1) automobiles, 2) airplanes, and 3) production of electric power.  material for the seminar will come from a wide range of sources, including a reference book ""how things work"", historical references, popular pseudo-technical periodicals, and technical journal articles.  we will discuss topics ranging from a) how to characterize the basic physical principles at work in the devices/systems to z) how popular opinion can affect the adoption or abandonment of sound technology."
fsae,100,academic english,3,"this course is designed to improve the fundamental reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills of students for whom english is not their first language.   one focus of the course will be refining written academic communication: identifying and producing common types of academic writing; note-taking from reading and listening inputs; understanding and applying principles of academic text structure; summarizing  and referencing information; editing and proofreading; and achieving appropriate tone and style. a second  focus will be honing spoken academic communication: recognizing the purposes of and differences between spoken and written english in academic contexts; identifying and practicing interactional and linguistic aspects of participation in seminar discussions; discussing issues requiring development and application of creative and critical thinking; and preparing and delivering oral presentations. a third focus will be on enhancing reading and listening skills in academic contexts: understanding the content and structure of information delivered both orally and in print form; and reading and listening for different purposes. a final focus will be improving and extending grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation."
fscs,150,first seminar continuing semester,3,"this is a continuation of the first seminar experience for esl students.  the seminar will continue the introduction to various dimensions of academic life.  it will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading from primary as well as secondary sources, and will include practice in written and oral communication in small groups.  the goals of the seminar are to continue to enhance basic intellectual skills of academic inquiry, such as critical reading, thoughtful analysis, and written and oral communication; to continue to introduce basic information literacy skills; to continue to provide a foundation for ethical decision-making; to continue to encourage a global and multidisciplinary perspective on the learning process; and to continue to facilitate faculty-student interactions.

fssy,112,shakespeare - still a hit,4,"what is the enduring appeal of the works of william shakespeare?  not only are the plays themselves popular today; there are also many film versions and adaptations, some recent and some dating back to the early days of cinema.  in this first seminar, students will read approximately six shakespeare plays, including at least one history, comedy, and tragedy.  in addition, they will view at least one film version or adaptation of each play.  with the help of kelvin smith library, the films will be made available on streaming video with password-protected access, enabling students to view them when convenient and as often as necessary.  since this class (like all first seminars) is writing-intensive, students will complete four formal essays as well as frequent in-class writing activities.  there will also be in-class readings from the plays, discussions of the various film adaptations, and one or two short oral presentations or activities."
fssy,113,movies and meaning,4,"this course explores methods for interpreting films.  to interpret a film is a more aggressive and creative activity than is simply viewing one.  how do critics and researchers of cinema  ""make meaning""?  what strategies do they use?  how does one mount a film interpretation that is both novel and persuasive?  the course will emphasize close reading of films as, each week, we screen a film and together discuss what meanings we can infer from it.  also each week, we'll read an essay that offers an interpretation of the film.  we'll analyze the reading in light of our sense of the film under consideration.  students will write short essays, approximately one every two weeks, in which they analyze the rhetorical and interpretive strategies of a given film analysis.  students will share their essays with the class, and these readings will serve as bases for class discussions.  final writing projects will consist of student interpretations of a film.  at least twice during the semester, the class will, in substitution for the weekly required evening screening, attend a film off campus--either at the cleveland cinematheque or at the cleveland museum of art.  the course emphasizes writing instruction and discussion in a seminar format.  there will be required evening screenings each week."
fssy,117,science and literature,4,"this course explores the treatment of scientific themes and the depiction of scientists in literature. this is not a course about science fiction: instead of envisioning future scientific advancements, science in literature pays close attention to the ways in which literary texts comment upon ongoing scientific debates and responds to the questionings of science. this four-credit-hour course also provides an introduction to various dimensions of academic life. it will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry. throughout the semester, we will foreground critical reading, thoughtful analysis, as well as written and oral communication."
fssy,135,the rest is silence,4,"the purpose of this course is to examine a widespread yet under-examined agent of the symbolic world: silence. without the delimiting, shaping power of silence, language would be a lump of indistinguishable sound. the title of the course comes from shakespeare: specifically, hamlet's last words. as we know, the rest (of hamlet) isn't silence: the play goes on for many more lines, beginning with horatio's well known valediction, ""now cracks a noble heart. good night sweet prince:/and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"" hamlet's last words give us a good view into the ambiguous nature of silence, the strange entanglement it has with boundaries, both formal, and metaphysical. we will study how silence is imbricated in different, even antithetical, practices: in the articulation of creative forms (with special attention to poetry); in methods of religious contemplation and meditation; as agent of ecological and political suppression; as sensory deprivation, or form of torture. silence continuously challenges and reorients our symbolic projects. as ana maria ochoa gautier argues, it forces us to question ""the binary logic of apparent opposites by dissolving one into the other (presence as absence, emptiness as plenitude, quietness as expressivity, silence as intensity of life)."" what we can know or say about silence will emerge from an ongoing discussion of texts that engage its properties--its paradoxes--differently. our semester-long study (and practice) of silence will draw on your powers of critical inquiry, reflection, and synthesis, as well as your powers of attention and imagination. seminar-style discussion and writing are the cornerstones of the course, which is designed to help you locate yourself in the surrounding structures and expectations of the academic community, especially its forms of conversation and writing. my hope is that as you explore and refine your relationship with silence, you will begin to identify and conserve it as an important resource in your academic life: as a refuge from information overload, as a ground for ethical decision-making, and as a guide to precision in speech and writing."
fssy,146,doc talk: language & medicine,4,"this course explores the role of language in constructing, experiencing, treating, and understanding the states we call ""health"" and ""illness."" we will ask questions such as: why do we fight cancer but mend broken bones? when (and how) do some experiences (e.g., sadness, hunger) become symptoms of disease? why do doctors ask where it hurts rather than when or how? is there a difference between saying that a patient is ""med compliant"" and that she has ""taken her prescription medicines""? to answer these questions (and to ask dozens more), we will read primary research on medical language, visit several of cleveland's nationally renowned cultural institutions, and discuss the symbolic and social meanings of a variety of medical terms, images, objects, and patterns of communication."
fssy,147,art and physics,4,"the twentieth century's advances in physics, from relativity to quantum mechanics and string theory, have offered distinctly new ways of looking at ourselves and the world around us.  it is no surprise that they have equally impacted different branches of the arts, revealing new possibilities for what to represent and how to represent it.  this course intends to explore this relationship between physics and art by taking two of those signal advances -- albert einstein's theory of relativity and werner heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- and considering how they inflect artistic models of expression such as painting (cubism), music (atonal composition), and literature (postmodern metafiction).  our goal is not to trace specific trains of influence (although they do exist) so much as to consider how parallel developments in the sciences and the arts emerge contemporaneously, and on that basis to reconstruct the conversation between them.  we will try to ask what each of these discursive models has to say to the others, and how the apparently unbridgeable gap between science and art might find some points of common contact."
fssy,153,what is mind?,4,"this seminar introduces students to the systematic study of the human mind, with a primary focus on general topics as the nature of perception, consciousness, intentionality, mental causation, and free will. in addition, we will take up the more specific topics of the transition from anatomically modern to behaviorally modern human beings, as well as debates over whether mind is identical with the brain, or if mind is an outcome of brains, body, and environment."
fssy,154,the imagination project,4,"for the first years of our schooling, we are taught to play make-believe. then, we are taught to understand facts. whatever happened to the imagination? what is it? what are the theories that help to explain it? and what is its place at a research university?
in this class, we will read, talk, think, and write about the purposes and scope of the human imagination, which is often understood as the symbolic realm of images and ideas that exists as part of our mental life. we will look at how the imagination has been understood by various thinkers and artists, and we will consider how the physical world interacts with the imagination in stories, music, film, and scientific ideas. even though we may think that imagination means ""something from nothing,"" it is much more complicated and collaborative than that, as we will see in our examination of larger imaginative projects such as the sistine chapel, star wars, legos, and disney world. we will examine the role of the imagination in as many disciplines as possible, including physics, sports, fantasy, politics, and the media. as we interrogate these sources, we will learn the basic tenets of argument and research that will help you in your upcoming sages courses. are there imaginative practices that can help us succeed here at case? how can we turn our own imaginations into reality?"
fssy,157,pursuits of happiness,4,"what is happiness?  and why do americans consider its pursuit a self-evident, inalienable right?  to what extent is happiness a component of the american dream?  how have writers used stories to illustrate the possibilities and limits of this ideal? this course examines the various ways that thinkers have defined happiness, using both theoretical frameworks and literary examples.  students will carefully analyze the validity and utility of these models, selecting elements to construct their own personal philosophies of happiness."
fssy,158,ecology in american literature and film,4,"how can american literature and film help us understand environmental issues?  this course will explore that question by investigating several of the foundational texts of the ecology movement in the united states.  many american authors and directors are sensitive to the natural beauty of the american continent and, therefore, emotionally and spiritually affected by environmental destruction.  scientific and political questions will be important for our inquiries, but we will emphasize the cultural and spiritual aspects of environmental thinking.  while science strives to understand nature and provides data documenting environmental conditions, and politics should propose pragmatic solutions, the will to act on scientific facts or political ideas requires emotional and ethical engagement, which literature and film particularly stress.  the expressive content and moral messages in literary memoirs and films complement scientific work and politics by allowing us to reflect on an obligation to preserve the natural environment.  consequently, this class will consider environmental awareness and the human connection to the natural world by examining writers' experiences.  our exploration will also consider dystopian stories that imagine where environmental disasters might lead.  possible texts include walden, desert solitaire, a sand county almanac, and movies like jeremiah johnson, into the wild, and wall-e."
fssy,175,god and the american writer,4,"how have american poets, novelists, and essayists thought about god? do they have anything to teach us about the role of religious belief in a country where religious believers make up the statistical majority? what could a late nineteenth century poet possibly teach us about the ways americans experience religious belief today? how could a fictional novel help us better understand the unique cultural history of religious belief in the us and its influence on today's society? 
this course seeks to address these questions by considering a particular strain of american writing that highly values the role of personal experience in religious faith. for these writers, god is not a philosophical idea hidden away in the abstractions of erudition, or a historical curiosity to be studied alongside ancient civilizations, but something to be experienced in an intense and personal way. for one writer god is the ""tender pioneer"" who americans would be cowardly not to venture after. another writer claims that the previous ""generations beheld god and nature face to face;"" he encourages his readers to ignore others' opinions and to seek their own ""original relation with the universe."" another proclaims that americans profess ""to love god whom they have not seen, while they hate their brother whom they have seen."" what similarities do these ideas share--what differences separate them? 
we will use these and other ideas to begin a conversation about why the personal experience of god seems so vital to america writers. we will discuss the ways american writers have created and critiqued the religious value of individuality, as well as how the category of ""personal experience"" can both hinder and help us in understanding american culture."
fssy,177,cosmic horror,4,"cosmic horror is the literary genre that most powerfully wrestles with the question of humanity's place in the universe as revealed by modern science. from its shadowy beginnings in the pulp fiction magazines of the nineteen twenties and thirties, cosmic horror has come to occupy the center of contemporary literary culture. prominent philosophers, ecologists, writers, and programmers have taken inspiration from the genre as they seek to discover meaning in a universe no longer centered on humanity. these works explore a physical world indifferent to human life and human meaning, a world in which human action shrivels into insignificance when faced with the abysses of cosmic temporal and spatial scales. in reading writers such as h. p. lovecraft and octavia butler, and philosophers and scientists such as eugene thacker and carlo rovelli, we will focus on several key questions. how does ""cosmic"" horror differ from other kinds of terror? what traditions, beliefs, or practices does modern science threaten for these writers? why have so many thinkers from diverse fields found themselves drawn to these works in recent years? what resources do these works offer for making sense of the environmental crisis?

this class, like other first seminars, is writing-intensive and will follow the seminar format. it is characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading from primary as well as secondary sources. this interdisciplinary course (investigating intersections of literature, philosophy, psychology, and science) will help you recognize the different perspectives that can be used to enter into a discussion on a subject, and enable you to make sometimes surprising connections across different fields, times, and genres."
fssy,182,mystery and the art of storytelling,4,"it's hard to resist a good story, and even harder to resist a good mystery story. what is it about mysteries that makes them so enduringly fascinating, so universal? what might they teach us about the nature of storytelling itself? in this course we'll discuss and write about how narrative works, taking mystery as our guide. in doing so, we'll also become better readers, viewers, and interpreters. for these stories make detectives out of us all, demanding that we evaluate textual evidence, seek out rhetorical clues, pay keen attention to detail, and even examine our own frameworks of perception. engaging both classic and less traditional tales of mystery and detection (including a movie or two), we'll examine the logic of such narratives, the desires and fears that drive them, and the secrets they tell--or try to keep hidden."
fssy,183,e-lit:  new media narrative,4,"imagine a book we might read by touching the words, choosing among possible paths or endings, or even by allowing our own faces or voices to be part of the scene.  electronic literature, that is, literary works designed to be read or experienced on a computer, often requires exactly such multisensory engagement, asking readers to make unusual connections between words, images, sounds, or movement, and, sometimes, to put themselves into the story.  in this class, we will read, experience, and write critically about electronic literature and experimental print literature, including works of interactive fiction, digital documentary, blogs, cut up and computer-generated poetry, digital games, and geo-locative fiction.  the works we read present unfamiliar, often non-linear, modes of writing, storytelling, or of conveying information.  such texts give us insight into how we ""read"" and how digital spaces influence the way we understand, experience, and respond to ideas, places, and people."
fssy,185b,jazz attitudes,4,"despised by the church, reviled by new orleans society, jazz was the bad boy music of the early 20th century.  but by wwii it was the most popular music style in the us. since then, jazz has become a minority taste, embraced by the academy, but viewed with an intimidated indifference by the general public. how did this happen? how have views of this odd marriage of european and african musical styles changed through the years?  can jazz regain relevancy? should jazz musicians even care about relevancy? and if not, what does the future hold for them and their music? in this course, we will examine the history of the development of jazz, what makes the music so important in american culture, and some of the reasons why--despite this importance--few people listen to it anymore. students need not have prior familiarity with jazz, only a willingness to listen to, and read about, the music."
fssy,185d,medieval mindsets,4,"do we get to be modern without first getting medieval? this seminar revisits and reexamines medieval modes of thinking and making. over the course of the semester, we will sample literary and material artifacts left behind by the medieval world. we will reconsider our obligations to the past and its stuff, are we responsible for/to medieval things and, if so, to what degree? we will take a hands-on approach to our objects of study. working in special collections and museums, with curators and artists, we will learn to decode medieval archives and artifacts. together, we will put medieval mindsets to the test."
fssy,185e,literary servants:  from homer to harry potter,4,"servants have played a surprisingly large role in some of the great works of western literature, though they often get overlooked in favor of their more noble masters and employers. in ""the odyssey,"" for example, when odysseus returns from the trojan war after 20 years at sea, he first gets recognized, not by his son or his wife, but by a childhood nurse who has served in his household all of his life. shakespearean-era plays also place servants in surprisingly central roles, having them not only performing tasks for their masters, but sometimes acting as romantic interests and close friends, or emblems of moral behavior. servants have taken on the role of primary protagonists in many works of 19th- and 20th-century literature, and have played an outsized role in countless other works. some of the questions that we will ask in this class include: why do these characters--who occupy the margins of the household and often perform seemingly mundane jobs--play this role in the literary and social imagination? do servants have unique identities, interests, and value systems or do they adopt the identities and values of the people they serve? to what extent are servants needed to establish the social positions of patriarchs, monarchs and the wealthy? the class will also explore the forms of power that servants are able to exert over those that they serve, and the extent to which this power both complicates and reinforces more commonly recognized systems of inequality like race, class and gender. readings will include several classic works of literature, and short philosophical works on human rights and the politics of the lower classes. we will also read some philosophical discussions of class and social hierarchy, watch and discuss some film and television representations of service, and visit the cleveland museum of art and the cleveland historical society in order to learn about the history of domestic service."
fssy,185k,the greek and roman humanities,4,"the civilizations that developed in ancient greece and ancient italy are called collectively ""classical civilization."" the study of the greek and roman humanities (languages, literature, arts, history, and philosophy) is known as ""classics.""  the greeks and romans have had a profound, widespread, and long-lasting influence on many aspects of subsequent western civilization, so studying the classical humanities is not only a rewarding endeavor in itself, but also can benefit those who want a deeper understanding of the modern arts and humanities. in this seminar we will read and discuss representative works by greek and roman authors in translation and look at artifacts produced in the ancient world in order to come to a better understanding of the foundations of the western humanities. we will also study the impact of greek and latin on english in order to understand how language can shape thought--an important thing to learn for anyone who is also trying to become a better writer! 
the seminar will investigate numerous questions about classics. where were the classical lands? when was the classical period? are there connections between greece or rome and other ancient civilizations? what were the sounds and sights of greece and rome? what remains of the ancient world in terms of language, literature, the arts? how have the classical humanities shaped modern concepts and institutions? where can one find tangible influences of greek and roman civilization in modern america?  why and when have modern people turned to greece and rome for inspiration?"
fssy,185p,on the road in america,4,"travel and exploration have long occupied a central role in the american imagination. the idea of the frontier, and the great westward expansion, gave birth to national myths and narratives based on transit and adventure. in recent years, americans have continued to reflect on the significance of physical journeys, as well as the inner quests that often accompany these modern-day pilgrimages. in this course, we will examine a diverse set of works that explore the long-standing american romance with adventure and movement. we will consider the impact of the open road on america's national identity, the powerful emotions and spiritual longing that lead people onto the road, and the forces that drive them off it."
fssy,185q,"death, mourning, and immortality",4,"although death and loss always have been part of the human experience, poems aching for immortality and mourning losses were especially important to people before the development of modern medicine because of the omnipresence of death in daily life. poems mourning losses were frequently (but not always) about death, and so we will occasionally consider what it means to mourn a still-living hero or to mourn the passing of a moment in time. a poem can become a ""moment's monument"" in one apt description. in this seminar, we will examine poetry from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries to explore the variety of ways that writers' religious beliefs, gender and sexual identities, and attitudes about desire and emotion informed how they thought about death, loss, mourning, and immortality. how does this poetry represent sadness and despair? in what ways does it affirm the joys of life and the memory of what has been lost? to supplement our investigation, we will also explore expressions of mourning that can be found in other genres of literature, as well as in museums and cemeteries. we will think about what it means to write yourself or others into immortality. no prior experience studying poetry is necessary, only a willingness to read with care and think with an open mind."
fssy,185r,children's picture books,4,"picture books may teach young readers basics like how to read, what sounds animals make, and how to count to ten, but they also shape children's perceptions of the world around them and influence the way they see themselves. in this seminar, we will study how children's picture books communicate social norms and ethics through the depiction of people and places. we will explore questions including: what kinds of places and spaces do picture books depict? how do characters treat others in these places, and how do they interact with non-human objects and the natural environment? whose voices are heard and whose are silenced in the stories and pictures? even though these books are written for children, what do they tell us about the adults who create, buy, or read them? how do these older readers understand children's spaces and childhood? by examining the underlying messages in these deceptively simple books, we can uncover surprisingly complicated visions of the world."
fssy,185u,on being human,4,"this seminar explores religious and philosophical views about what it means to be human. we will address questions such as: to what extent are we free? does freedom conflict with traditional authority, our own pasts, our irrational impulses, or our physical natures? what is the relationship between reason and emotion? how well do we know our own motives? and to what extent are we hidden to ourselves? to investigate these questions, we will read, discuss, and write about a range of classical and contemporary religious and philosophical thinkers. each offers a different perspective about the nature of the human being, human excellence, and what it means to live a life of integrity. they are also enduringly relevant to our lives, inside and outside of the classroom. together, the texts and thinkers constitute a conversation filled with sometimes competing and sometimes complementary views about who we are, why we do the things we do, and what sorts of lives we ought to lead."
fsso,119,philanthropy in america,4,"this four-credit course provides an introduction to various dimensions of philanthropy and volunteerism.  using the seminar format and an array of interactive activities, we will conduct a broad but intellectual inquiry into the systems and ethics of giving time and money to charitable causes.  in four units of inquiry, we will consider the giving traditions that have influenced american culture and society since its colonial days.  we will examine the role that the third sector (also known as the independent or nonprofit sector) plays as an agent of social change in a functioning democratic republic.  we will explore the nature of donors and volunteers and take a critical look at the missions and goals of a cross section of nonprofit organizations.  we will wrestle with ethical issues related to philanthropy and consider the giving patterns of different social, religious, and ethnic groups.  we will also turn our collective thinking to how the nonprofit sector might better serve the social needs of the nation and the world.  at the end of the semester, we will reflect on how our ideas about philanthropy have changed over the course of fifteen weeks."
fsso,120,poverty and social policy,4,"this course has two major foci: poverty and social policies designed to ameliorate poverty. sociologists in the united states and in other countries have made major contributions to studies of poverty. they have primarily focused on income-based poverty, but more recently, have also studied other forms of poverty. in this class, we will examine different conceptualizations and measures of poverty. we will then examine short-term and long-term poverty experiences and their potential consequences. we will then turn to explanations of poverty: why are some individuals more likely  to experience periods of low income than others? while the united states will be the focus of the course, we will contrast the experiences of other countries. the second component will be an analysis of social policies designed to ameliorate poverty. in particular, we will examine the development and retrenchment of welfare states and other social policies, the various goals of social policy, and the different impacts social policies have had on individuals, families, other groups, and the country overall. this discussion will reflect on experiences of other countries."
fsso,122,china in modernization,4,"this four credit-hour course provides an introduction to various dimensions of modernization in contemporary china, especially cultural and social changes such as consumption, education, migration, and tourism as a result of economic reforms, trade expansion, foreign investments and technology transfer, especially the development of information technology.  the seminar will also asses the impacts of these changes on various aspects of globalization and vice versa.  it will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading relevant material, and will include practice in written and oral communication in discussion forums and small groups.  the goals are to enhance basic intellectual skills of academic inquiry, such as critical reading, thoughtful analysis, and written and oral communication; to introduce basic information on literacy skills; to provide a foundation for ethical decision-making; to encourage a global and multidisciplinary perspective on the learning process; to facilitate faculty-student interactions; and, in the most general sense, to provide a supportive common intellectual experience at cwru."
fsso,123,ten developments that are shaking the world,4,"this seminar is an introduction to some of the most important global developments of our times.  we will examine these events through political, historical, economic, cultural, sociological, scientific and ethical lenses.  readings will come from a wide-range of sources, and assignments will include exercises in written and oral communication.  the professor will choose the first three global developments to be investigated as well as the relevant readings.  his topics will most likely be the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the rise of china as a great power and the fiftieth anniversary of the european union.  each of the remaining seven will be chosen by small groups of students, who will assign the readings and run the sessions for their respective topic.  possible topics include the global food crisis, genocide and the failure of the world community to stop it, global warming and the growing gap between the world's rich and poor."
fsso,126,religion and the ethics of war,4,"although war is a highly rational, organized and purposeful affair, it also is the most destructive and bloody of human activities.  for this reason, war and warfare has always been subject to various religious and moral restrictions.  as technology has developed, the conduct of war has changed and the definitions of just and unjust war, as well as what it means to fight justly, have undergone profound changes.  this course looks at war and warfare from a variety of angles and examines how various religious and moral thinkers have tried to define just war, and create guidelines for fighting a war justly.  at the end of the semester, the course looks at the moral challenges presented by new technologies and new concepts of war."
fsso,128,movers and shakers: leadership,4,"""never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  indeed, it is the only thing that ever has"" (margaret mead, 1901-1978).  this seminar is about understanding what enables people to make a generative impact on the world.  students will explore the socio-emotional and motivational characteristics of effective leaders and their ability to create positive change.  students will also be encouraged to develop their own theories of leadership and to explore their personal approaches to making a difference.  the seminar will profile leaders from different occupations and walks of life.  seminar sessions will feature assigned readings on leaders and change agents, class discussion on what drives movers and shakers, and individual and group presentations on class members' emergent leadership perspectives.

a key objective of the seminar is the development of critical thinking skills, writing skills, and verbal skills.  consequently, the weekly class readings, reflection papers on class readings, class discussions, class presentations (individual and group), and final project are vital features of the seminar experience.  students will be expected to leave the seminar with a grounded perspective on leaders and leadership, and the ability to articulate their own personal views on making a difference in the world."
fsso,136,the founding fathers,4,"americans often disparage politicians and u.s. political institutions, like congress and the presidency.  nonetheless, the same americans often revere the men and women who founded the country and designed the political system that seems to give us so much trouble.  this four credit-hour course explores american political thought from our country's founding to the present through the prism of the founding fathers.  it will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry into all of the contradictions inherent in the writings and lives of  the founding fathers and contemporary american politics, guided by reading from primary as well as secondary sources."
fsso,140,working-class literature,4,"in her volume, silences (1978), writer tillie olson refers to the relationship between social class and literature as ""the great unexamined."" this statement still largely rings true, despite the continued production of novels, films, and poems depicting the working-class, and despite the unprecedented growth in recent years of america's working class.  in this course, we will examine the relationship between social class and literature, reading narratives written by and about laborers in the hopes of understanding the complexities of working-class life in america, including the intricate ways in which economic status mediates one's sense of identity. beginning our study with mid-to-late nineteenth-century works, we will consider ideas about economics, race, and gender that have shaped and that continue to influence the depiction of the working-class.  throughout the course, we will pair literary and historical readings with pop-cultural materials, viewing films, listening to music, and analyzing visual arts both in class and on visits to cleveland cultural institutions such as the western reserve historical society and the maltz museum of jewish history."
fsso,143,living with and making decisions concerning injustice,4,"injustice. what do you think of when you hear that word? there are all types of injustice in this world, and chances are that during our lifetime we will either find ourselves in a position or system of power, perpetrating injustice on others; or in a position or system of supposed impotence, a subject of injustice. what are our choices? how will we respond? in this course we will examine the topic of living with and making decisions concerning injustice using, as an example, the specific injustice of slavery, examining the lives and decisions of both a famous slaveholder and two not-so-famous slaves; and learning from their lives and decisions how we might, ourselves, live with and make decisions concerning injustices we face in our lives."
fsso,145,"berlin in history, history in berlin",4,"from its emergence as a fishing village in the sandy marshes of the eastern frontier of germany, to its 21st-century role as a cosmopolitan metropolis, berlin has embodied the arc of change over time in human society. this course uses the history of the city of berlin as the lens through which to contemplate the complexity of human social and cultural arrangements, their expression in economics and politics (including war), and the imbrication of human cultural and social constructions with the ""natural"" world.

we will read books and articles about the history, culture, economy, and politics of berlin, primarily from its establishment as the capital of new german empire in 1871 to the present. we will view films that introduce us to the manic energy that berlin represented in the transition to modernity. we will visit local museums that house examples of the material culture of berlin, from the cleveland museum of art to the rock and roll hall of fame and museum. we will listen to the music of berlin, from the baroque of the brandenburg concertos to the heavy metal of the skorpions. and we will learn its history, from fishing village, to court city, to imperial metropolis and industrial engine, to divided symbol of the cold war, to de-industrialized center of art, government, education, and incubator of high-technology.

this first seminar will prepare students to pursue their undergraduate degrees grounded in thinking about places in time, about change over time, and about human creativity, while preparing them to write and speak about their arguments with clarity and grace."
fsso,146,"the past and future of art, architecture and museums in cleveland",4,"during the gilded age, cleveland became one of this country's most powerful centers of business, industry, and political power.  for example, john d. rockefeller, who started his business career in cleveland, became the wealthiest individual in human history, and mark hanna, the leader of cleveland's republican political machine, selected and engineered the election of eight ohio-born presidents of the united states, setting a state record which is still unbroken.  as late as the 1930s, henry luce located the headquarters of time, life and fortune magazines in cleveland; and the terminal tower, the nexus of the vast, sprawling railroad and real-estate empire of the van sweringen brothers, was the country's highest building outside of new york.  this class will examine one of the by-products of this accumulation of power and money: the flowering of art and culture in cleveland during the early 20th century, and the creation of notable cultural institutions, such as one of this country's finest symphony orchestras, one of its top ten art museums, a major university, and an array of other notable entities, many of them housed in buildings of architectural distinction.  the class will also examine the economic, cultural and intellectual decline of cleveland in the second half of the 20th century, and recent attempts to reverse this trend through intensive efforts to revitalize university circle.  in addition to classroom sessions, the course will include field trips to the cleveland museum of art, the western reserve historical society, and the museum of contemporary art, and an architectural tour of downtown cleveland.  the class will be centered on three interrelated questions: what makes a great city?  how can the artistic and cultural life of a great city be developed and sustained?  how can the social and economic collapse of a great city be reversed?"
fsso,147,critical attitude,4,"in his essay, ""what is enlightenment?"" immanuel kant said enlightenment begins with the courage to use your own understanding -as opposed to following the mindset of your parents, teachers, or ministers. two hundred years later, the great french social historian michel foucault called the kantian idea of enlightenment, ""critique."" for foucault, the essential is a critical attitude.  in this seminar, we pursue the thread of a critical attitude focusing on three areas of your life: culture, work, and school.  for reasons we will see, politics will remain in the background, as the un-broached dimension.  the month on culture is called ""osmosis,"" the month on work ""treadmill"" and the month on school ""brainwash.""  in this dark(ly humorous) course, we join selected readings in the tradition of critical theory with contemporary and classic films.  and we visit local cultural institutions, and events -as well as riding through the city with a critical attitude."
fsso,149,"creativity in the arts, sciences, and engineering",4,"this seminar will have a focus on creativity in the arts, sciences, and engineering.  what are the similarities and differences in the creative process in these three different broad fields?  how are the creative products different?  what are the creative processes involved in these different domains.  are there differences in personalities between scientists and artists?  how can we foster creativity in children and adults in these fields?  we all read about and discuss the different dimensions of creativity; what makes something creative; what helps people become creative; the role of cognition and emotion in the creative process in the arts and sciences; and mental illness and creativity."
fsso,151,"border crossings: travel, culture, and identity",4,"this seminar will explore the transformative nature of travel, especially in regard to individual and cultural identity.  through seminar discussions, extensive writing and revision, and formal oral presentations, our class will explore how individuals, including ourselves, define themselves in personal, local, and national contexts and how we redefine ourselves and our world as we cross geographical borders.  course texts will include works of fiction, non-fiction travel narratives, films, and scholarly essays that will compel us to question our everyday world and consider matters of cultural exchange and social belonging."
fsso,152,decision making in everyday life,4,"although social cognition allows us to process vast amounts of information quickly, we are not always aware of the subtle forces that guide our decision making.  this course will use a seminar approach to explore rational and irrational forces that influence decision making.  we will use a multi-disciplinary approach to decision making, including topics such as personality factors, incentive-based decision making, cognitive biases, automatic information processing, and theories of mind.  these topics will be explored using class discussion, writings, and student presentations."
fsso,153,reading social justice: the anisfield-wolf book awards,4,"in this seminar, we will read a selection of poetry, short stories and books and use them as a framework to explore questions related to understanding tolerance, social justice and diversity.  we will begin by establishing a definition of and methodology for addressing these issues in our discussion and writing, and build upon them as the semester progresses.  much of the fiction and nonfiction we will read will be by winners of the anisfield-wolf book awards.  in addition to our reading, we will also analyze and discuss a selection of films, art works and music related to our theme.  our fourth hour experiences will include attending the awards ceremony in september, visits to cultural institutions within university circle, lectures and guest speakers.  while the primary goal of the class is to help students develop their critical thinking and writing skills, it is also intended to introduce them to a vital, cleveland-based literary institution.  by engaging the themes, texts, and authors of anisfield-wolf, students will have a deeper understanding not only of contemporary literature, but the importance of social justice to a liberal arts education."
fsso,157,being in touch: animal and human considerations,4,"this is a seminar designed to refine skills of critical thinking and reading, listening, learning. writing and verbal presentation while considering the topic of touch.  we will consider touch in different situations and for different purposes - touch in child development, touch in socialization, therapeutic animal touch, touch and violence/harassment, touch in the workplace, touch and technology, taste as a function of touch, healing touch comforting and noxious touch, and things we are afraid to touch."
fsso,158,the symphony orchestra-cultural treasure or outmoded symbol?,4,"in measuring the cultural profile of a metropolitan area, the presence of a successful symphony orchestra is often used as a model to determine culture sophistication and refinement. in recent years, however, the model of the orchestra has encountered significant challenges. using the world-renowned cleveland orchestra as a paradigm, this seminar will examine the role of the orchestra in ascertaining a city's cultural health. topics of discussion, oral presentations, and writing assignments will address the historical legacy of the classical orchestra; traditional concert-going etiquette and its relevance in 21st-century culture; how orchestras have handled recent financial trials; and defining the importance of the orchestra in today's urban society. students will have the opportunity to attend orchestral concerts during fourth hour, and occasional guests from the cleveland orchestra and other university circle institutions will provide a direct cultural perspective."
fsso,160,brazil inside and out,4,"in this seminar we will engage in the exploration of brazil's history, society, and culture from a multidisciplinary and comparative perspective. host of the latest soccer cup and summer olympics, brazil is one of the largest and most diverse countries in the world, as well as one the largest economies and democracies. known by its natural beauty and resources, tropical climate, vibrant culture and friendly population, the land of soccer and carnival is also marked by inequality, poverty, corruption, and violence. due to this complex, challenging and fascinating profile, brazil defies easy categorizations and provides a unique context for the development of essential academic skills. over the course of the semester, you will have the opportunity to read, analyze and discuss relevant academic sources, news articles and audiovisual materials, like music and films; learn and experience first-hand basic aspects of brazilian language and culture, including food and music; and interact with brazilian students and faculty on campus."
fsso,161,the craft of cloth: textile production since the industrial revolution,4,"what counts as hand made? since the industrial revolution, modes of production have been increasingly mechanized to ensure efficient production involving fewer skilled workers. opposition to industrialization has existed since the earliest moments of the revolution, when skilled stocking knitters destroyed stocking frames, a technology meant to replace them by putting the ability to create stockings in the hands of unskilled laborers. today, we find ourselves in the midst of a hyper-technological age, but with an increasingly vocal artisanal subculture valorizing the artist or craftsperson who creates unique goods by hand. our class will explore the tensions and sympathies between industry and craft, the machine and the hand, technology and the imagination. we will focus our inquiry on the production of cloth, since it was the need to produce cloth more efficiently that motivated the industrial revolution's earliest technological innovations. we will consider the human relationships and institutions that support the production of textiles and cloth (especially silk and cotton) and which, in turn, create global and local economies that influence social organization. this seminar will be discussion based and writing intensive, and will include field trips to a local clothing factory and to the art museum to see and analyze historic fabrics. we will also speak with local fashion and textile designers. students will experiment with knitting, weaving, or a cloth craft of their choice in order to participate in the technical--and creative--side of cloth production."
fsso,164,"social change, genes, and environment",4,"this seminar will focus on the rapidly expanding understanding of the interaction of biological and social forces--including the interaction of genes and environment.  we will explore claims that are made in science and popular culture about the role of genes in development.  we will focus on the role that social forces play in shaping the effects of genes in development, and health, through epigenetics and related mechanisms.  adopting a sociology-of-science perspective, we will consider the wider and future implications of gene-environment interactions for politics, the economy, and culture."
fsso,165,identities and social inequality,4,"in this course, students examine diversity, privilege, and power in us society. social categories such as gender, heritage, language, race, religion, and sexuality affect the status of both individuals and groups, at times producing unequal distribution of resources and marginalization. no group or individual belongs to one category; therefore, we will also consider how the intersection of these categories produces their own unique effects. students are expected to analyze and critique social institutions, belief systems, and practices that promote inequality and social justice through data- based dialogue and writing. modes of inquiry will include quantitative and qualitative research methods and current scholarly literature. this course is conducted in a seminar format that requires students to engage in active, relevant and insightful discussions regarding the course content. students have the opportunity to hear from guest experts in the field and participate in off-campus learning activities. reflective and scholarly writing are major components of the course."
fsso,169,the history of your lifetime: making sense of the last twenty years,4,"no matter when you grow up, adults make assumptions about what you know, ""you lived through certain events, didn't you? those events are often very important--the basis of political and policy debates or related to subjects that affect daily life--but it's often difficult to make sense of history you've lived through, but only as children. the usual way we learn about the past--in history classes--isn't very helpful because this is a time period that usually goes beyond what your teachers have been able to cover.

even if you could have covered this recent time period in history class, unfortunately, most recent subjects haven't received much attention from historians; the archives aren't yet available and we lack much critical distance in making judgments about what is significant and what isn't. we aren't yet sure which assumed causes of historical change are plausible and which only seemed so at the time. this time period usually constitutes most of the student's lifetime--your lifetime.

this class takes these challenges head-on, examining the last 20 years of history. aside from covering the ""what happened"" for several selected topics, we will attempt to go further and explore how historians think about contemporary events, place current events into longer historical contexts, develop skills in media literacy to better evaluate the quality of information we receive, and discuss the uses and misuses of historical analogies in public debate. we will also investigate the importance of structural narrative in making sense of historical events and processes: what questions do we ask of the past and why those questions and not others? why do our questions about the past change over time? how do present circumstances affect our historical work? when do we draw our chronological boundaries; when do our stories start and when do they end?"
fsso,171,prediction,4,"this course is an interdisciplinary examination of predictions about social events, how we make them, why they go wrong, and how we respond. while some things, like election results, are easy to predict, dramatic events like wars, depressions, and stock market crashes are harder to predict. the course will begin with the basic elements of probability theory to lay the groundwork for the class. then, we will examine the psychological research on the types of errors people are prone to make regarding probability and the consequences of such biases in perception and estimation. the course will then move on to discuss predicting specific social events, such as elections and stock trends, comparing the empirical research to conventional beliefs. then the course will address the role of scholarly research more generally, and the empirical work discussing how political scientists, economists, and other scholars often fail to predict the most significant and dramatic events because of their cognitive styles, which vary in the degree to which they rely on simplified models. finally, the course will discuss how people respond when their predictions go wrong, and their basic tendency to rationalize away errors."
fsso,172,islam in south asia,4,"there are more muslims in south asia than in any other region of the world. but within the region, islam is far from a monolith. what variety of religious practices and traditions of debate have characterized south asian muslims? when meshed with different political projects, how do we understand islam as a deeply contested ideological field? what roles did muslims play in the history of south asia? these are some of the questions we will pursue in the seminar. 

the long history of muslim presence in the region--which now includes india, pakistan, bangladesh, and afghanistan--will offer opportunities for studying them in a wide range of historical contexts: as actors in cosmopolitan, commercial networks of trade; as rulers consolidating states and empires governing large multi-ethnic and multi-religious populations; as ""modernizers"" and ""traditionalists;"" as religious minorities and majorities in different nation-states. additionally, this seminar will explore islam in an array of modern settings: from a nation-state created as a ""muslim homeland"" to a rejection of religion as an adequate basis of national identity; from democracy to military rule; and, from cold war politics to the ""global war on terror."""
fsso,176,savor:  the ethics and politics of eating,4,"our food choices affect more than our individual health; what we decide to put into our bodies has important consequences for our environment, the livelihood of farmers, and even the general well-being of a society.  these choices also reveal moral, cultural, and religious values we deem important. in this seminar, we will examine the environmental and social consequences of our food choices by interrogating both our individual habits as well as current (often controversial) food policy issues. in line with the requirements of a sages first seminar, this course is designed to improve students' ability to read critically and interpret moral and political arguments. we will analyze a wide range of writings on food-related issues in order to develop sophisticated perspectives on our food choices. hopefully, this thoughtful consideration will translate to mindful habits when we convene around food with our friends, families, and communities. class discussions will be accompanied by class visits to urban gardens, restaurants with a sustainability mission, and farmers' markets. we'll also meet representatives of community organizations like the greater cleveland food bank."

desn,308,business model design and innovation,3,"this course takes the perspective of entrepreneurs or business unit managers. the three basic questions that all entrepreneurs and intrepreneurs must answer is where to play, how to win and what to do.  you have identified a group of customers for your product or service (where to play).  your first challenge is to know what features (customer attributes) your target customer will pay for. innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call focal attributes. your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  the concept called profit objectives (similar but not the same as kpi and/or smart objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  at this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives. you will learn how to illustrate this alignment through a mapping process.

desn,410,leading digital innovation by design,3,"a new wave of digital revolution is transforming every industrial sector. powered by increasingly smaller yet potent microprocessors and sensors, a new generation of analytical tools, and ubiquitous wearable and mobile devices, companies can radically transform the way they interact with users and the way they create and capture value. technology like block chain and ai are likely to fundamentally reshape how we think about firms and industries. such changes make existing strategic frameworks and tools obsolete. in order to understand how and why digital technology changes the industrial landscape, companies must understand some of the fundamental characteristics of digital technology and how it demands new types of value creation logic. 

be it a large corporation or a small start-up; or a government agency or a multinational enterprise; everyone is struggling to deal with the new digital reality. yet, exactly how to use digital technology to create value is not clear. while all companies must understand how digital technology is fundamentally different from other forms of technology, ironically digital innovation is not about technology. digital innovation is making digital technology meaningful and value to users. therefore, digital innovation requires us to truly understand us (people), what we do, why we do what we do, what makes us happy, and what we consider meaningful. therefore, digital innovation is a deeply humanistic exploration to make digital technology meaningful and valuable to us. 

in order to fully harness the transformative capacity of digital technology, we must gain deeper insights on people and their actions, meanings and values. in this experiential course, we use design as the primary tool to gain such humanistic insights, and work with real-world projects to apply those ideas and tools to build real digital innovations."

cogs,305,social cognition and the brain,3,"human beings develop intricate means of presenting themselves to others; of representing others as friends, enemies, or strangers; of making quick assessments of any situation based on the attribution of intentions; of sizing up the other via symbols and other shibboleths; and of the disposition and ability to empathize and sympathize with the emotional states of others for specific purposes. in recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. it is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.
this course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).
by term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience. each student will articulate a research problem and develop a method for investigating it through independent and collaborative means of practicing their research, critical thinking, writing and communication skills.

cogs,348,buddhism and cognitive science,3,"in 1987, the dalai lama initiated a yearly event--mind and life dialogues--to address ""critical issues of modern life at the intersection of scientific and contemplative understanding"". dialogue topics included issues related to buddhist thought and practice, and cognitive science. others with an interest in the intersection of buddhism and cognitive science, such as robert wright in why buddhism is true: the science and philosophy of meditation and enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. the notion that at least some aspects of buddhism are ""true"" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.
this seminar explores buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. we start with a general overview of buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. for instance, we will explore the buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). this idea resonates with daniel dennett's notion of the ""narrative self"" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.
although the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.

cogs,391,introduction to text semiotics,3,"introduction to text semiotics addresses both students of literature and students in cognitive science.  most of the authors included in the reading list extend their linguistic approach towards fields that intersect literature, psychology, philosophy, aesthetics, and anthropology.  the scholarly traditions of text analysis and structural theory of meaning, including authors from classical formalism, structuralism, structural semiotics, and new criticism will be connected to cognitive theories of meaning construction in test, discourse, and cultural expressions in general.  the focus of this course, taught as a seminar, is on empirical studies, specific text analyses, discourse analyses, speech act analyses, and other studies of speech, writing, and uses of language in cultural contexts.  this course thus introduces to a study of literature and cultural expressions based on cognitive science and modern semiotics--the new view that has be coined cognitive semiotics.

cogs,402,advanced introduction to cognitive neuroscience,3,"this course takes an advanced look at how the methods of cognitive neuroscience can be used to inform theories of cognitive function, with implications for a range of disciplines.  students will be given an overview of methods, brain anatomy, and major findings in the field.  in addition, they will read a number of primary source papers.  the student may expect to come away from the course with a broad acquaintance with modern cognitive neuroscience, how its findings are relevant to a variety of fields, and how to critically assess primary source material.
cognitive neuroscience is a rapidly evolving field which synthesizes methodologies and conceptual frameworks from numerous different disciplines.  no single individual can hope to master all the methods, background knowledge and conceptual systems which are of key importance to the discipline at any one point in time.  cognitive neuroscience is therefore a group activity, in which progress is critically dependent on group interactions both at a local level (the `lab') and at more distributed levels (the wider scientific/academic community).  the key objectives of this introductory course are therefore:
1. to give students a basic overview of current methods in cognitive neuroscience and the current state of knowledge in the field.
2. to enable students to go to, read, understand, research and evaluate the primary literature (i.e. journal articles).
3. to train students in the skills involved in group work, in particular through division of work and integration of acquired knowledge at a local level (i.e. lab-sized group), through effective and clear presentation of work, and through productive interactions with a large community.
the first objective will be accomplished through lectures and assigned textbook readings.  the second goal will be accomplished through assigned journal article readings.  the third goal will be accomplished through a group structured format for accomplishing work, and through `journal club' style presentations to the class."
cogs,405,social cognition and the brain,3,"human beings develop intricate means of presenting themselves to others; of representing others as friends, enemies, or strangers; of making quick assessments of any situation based on the attribution of intentions; of sizing up the other via symbols and other shibboleths; and of the disposition and ability to empathize and sympathize with the emotional states of others for specific purposes. in recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. it is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.
this course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).
by term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience. each student will articulate a research problem and develop a method for investigating it through independent and collaborative means of practicing their research, critical thinking, writing and communication skills.

cogs,448,buddhism and cognitive science,3,"in 1987, the dalai lama initiated a yearly event--mind and life dialogues--to address ""critical issues of modern life at the intersection of scientific and contemplative understanding"". dialogue topics included issues related to buddhist thought and practice, and cognitive science. others with an interest in the intersection of buddhism and cognitive science, such as robert wright in why buddhism is true: the science and philosophy of meditation and enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. the notion that at least some aspects of buddhism are ""true"" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.
this seminar explores buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. we start with a general overview of buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. for instance, we will explore the buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). this idea resonates with daniel dennett's notion of the ""narrative self"" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.
although the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.

clsc,222,classical tradition 2: birth of archaeology,3,"the course will focus on the history of diverse methods for studying societies remote in time and space; i.e., on the formation of the distinct disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, and the interest in the origins of human society and cultural practices.  the birth of archaeology occurred in the context of the profound transformation of european cultural life in the eighteenth century, the era of the enlightenment.  on the basis of a range of cultural productions (literary and historical texts, objects of luxury and use, etc.), we will study visual and literary works and consider the relationship between different modes of artistic production and expression, as well as the marketing and display of prestigious objects, whether ancient or modern.  we will consider the eighteenth-century model of experiential education, the ""grand tour,"" and the formation of private and public collections, as well as the emergence of the museum as institution.  finally, we will also consider important recent work on the relationship between the production of luxury commodities (sugar, coffee, tea, etc.) through the plantation economy in the americas and beyond and the development of attitudes and ideas in europe.

clsc,321,"the archaeology of iron age italy and sicily, ca",1000-300,"this course traces the early history and archaeology of the italian peninsula and sicily from ca. 1000 bce to 300 bce.  during this period, the movement of people brought with a transfer of people, ideas, and culture (both social and material) that would transform the population and landscape of ancient italy and sicily. we will look first at southern italy and sicily, where, from about 750 bce, greek and phoenician colonists settled.  we will examine the characteristics of greek and phoenician colonies and monuments, as well as the characteristics of the interactions between the new arrivals and the indigenous population, especially the sikels.  we will then examine how the villanovan culture was supplanted by the etruscans in west-central italy.  through the close examination of the material culture we will address topics such as status, urbanization, religion and ritual, and the cultures of italy and sicily within the wider mediterranean world.  finally, we will look at another movement of people and politics: the expansion of roman hegemony throughout the peninsula.  numerous theories attempt to explain the effect roman occupation had on the other populations.  we will analyze critically these theories and look for ourselves on the numerous ways indigenous populations could respond to ""foreign"" occupiers and how the occupiers responded to the indigenes.  we will ""read"" material culture almost like text, guided by concepts such as ""style,"" ""agency"" and ""habitus"" among others.  through these lenses we will examine the archaeological material from multiple points of view (social, economic, religious, political). in turn, recent theoretical advances that seek to explain the processes of accommodation and emulation of, and resistance to, outside cultural influences will be looked at with a critical eye so that we can come away with fresh ideas about understanding what, and who, culture really is.

some of the questions we will be asking when visiting the sites include: how did the expansion of the roman empire influence the stylistic repertories of the capital's artists and architects? how did the changing political environment shape the topography of the city from republic to empire? how can we read political messages and propaganda in the ancient structures? how did (and does) rome live among, use, and reuse ancient remains?

astr,433,dark matter,3,"this course will systematically explore the evidence for dark matter in the universe.  necessary physical theory and astronomical concepts will be developed as appropriate. topics to be covered include gravitational dynamics, gravitational lensing, and hydrostatic equilibrium as probes of the gravitational potentials of extragalactic systems.  examples include the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, the oort discrepancy in the local galactic disk, the dynamics of pressure supported dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies, and the local group timing problem.  in clusters of galaxies, the mass discrepancy is illustrated separately by measured velocity dispersions, the hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot intracluster medium, and both strong and weak gravitational lensing.  on cosmic scales, the course will address evidence from the gravitating and baryonic mass content of the universe, the growth of large scale structure from the initially smooth cosmic microwave background, and the existence of large voids and large scale bulk flows.  the course will describe the various dark matter halo models commonly employed and introduce the techniques of mass modeling.  we will examine hypotheses for the nature of dark matter, both baryonic and non-baryonic, and discuss strategies for experimental detection of plausible dark matter candidates.  theories that seek to explain the observed mass discrepancies by means of modifying the law of gravity rather than invoking dark matter will be explored.

amst,117,exploring american history through biography,3,"this discussion and lecture class uses various forms of biography to explore issues of american identity throughout the course of american history.  the class will discuss how certain biographies have created archetypal american identities, and how issues such as race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, and historical context have shaped the writing, reading and purpose of biography.
the last third of the class will consider the process of ""national memory,"" the way the united states has decide to remember its past.  here the ""biography"" is collective, and created by myriad strands of mass culture woven together to create a national mythology.  we will explore the works of those striving to pull apart these different strands, and explore what these memories tell us about established national identity.
students will explore biographical process through their assignments, and consider such questions as: how do american biographies influence our understanding of what it means to be american?  how does biographical medium affect the message?  can we accept biography as history?  this course investigates biography as a constructed genre that comes in a variety of forms, including autobiography, biographical novels, oral histories, and film.

arth,325,"art at the crossroads of religion: polytheistic, christian, and islamic art in antiquity",3,"people often single out the reign of constantine (a.d. 306-337) as the point in history when rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a christian empire. this course questions the strict divide between the categories of ""pagan"" and ""christian"" in rome in the imperial period and beyond. through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the roman empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after constantine ""christianized"" the empire. moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of roman culture since the founding of ancient rome. we will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. we will also examine sites such as the border city of dura-europos in syria to explore how religious identities in the roman empire (including judaism, early christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when rome was still supposedly a ""pagan"" empire. the course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under constantine, whom people today often remember as rome's first christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. we will also explore how christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the roman empire. finally, we will examine how early islamic art and architecture exploited the greco-roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.

arth,336,representations of war in ancient rome,3,"few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. this course examines the many ways that romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the roman republic in 509 b.c.e. to the reign of constantine (306-337 c.e.). why did romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape romans' military values? what can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the roman world? we will explore major public monuments in the city of rome (including triumphal arches and the colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. we will also examine monuments on the edges of rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern france and romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between romans and the peoples they conquered. students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of rome's military efforts, to subvert rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be roman"" as wars transformed rome from a small city in italy to a massive, pan-mediterranean empire. after exploring romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the roman empire and modern america is appropriate.

arth,425,"art at the crossroads of religion: polytheistic, christian, and islamic art in antiquity",3,"people often single out the reign of constantine (a.d. 306-337) as the point in history when rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a christian empire. this course questions the strict divide between the categories of ""pagan"" and ""christian"" in rome in the imperial period and beyond. through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the roman empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after constantine ""christianized"" the empire. moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of roman culture since the founding of ancient rome. we will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. we will also examine sites such as the border city of dura-europos in syria to explore how religious identities in the roman empire (including judaism, early christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when rome was still supposedly a ""pagan"" empire. the course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under constantine, whom people today often remember as rome's first christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. we will also explore how christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the roman empire. finally, we will examine how early islamic art and architecture exploited the greco-roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.

arth,436,representations of war in ancient rome,3,"few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. this course examines the many ways that romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the roman republic in 509 b.c.e. to the reign of constantine (306-337 c.e.). why did romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape romans' military values? what can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the roman world? we will explore major public monuments in the city of rome (including triumphal arches and the colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. we will also examine monuments on the edges of rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern france and romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between romans and the peoples they conquered. students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of rome's military efforts, to subvert rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to ""be roman"" as wars transformed rome from a small city in italy to a massive, pan-mediterranean empire. after exploring romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the roman empire and modern america is appropriate.

arth,498,history and practice of connoisseurship,3,"in this seminar we will consider the history, historiography , and practice of connoisseurship.  in western cultures connoisseurship, the practice of attributing works of art to specific artists, regions, and time periods and assessing their quality, can be traced back to classical antiquity.  it was practiced with renewed vigor in europe from the sixteenth century onward and in the nineteenth century was a foundational methodology for the academic discipline of art history.  while it came under criticism in the twentieth century as a method too closely aligned with the art market, connoisseurship continues to be practiced today, especially in museums and auction houses, as a vital and necessary methodological approach.  in recent decades art historians have also begun to reevaluate the history, practices and historiographic importance of this methodology.  class discussions of the scholarly literature of connoisseurship and case studies of its practice will alternate with sessions held in the cleveland museum of art to examine objects from the permanent collections.  the museum sessions, led by curators and conservators, will also emphasize the role that physical condition plays in making connoisseurship assessments.  specific topics will be designated each time the course is offered.

anth,425,economic anthropology,3,"economic anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology that examines how people in modern and non-modern societies produce, distribute, exchange, and consume goods, services, and other valued resources. the sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. however, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.

this course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. the history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. this class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common. on this backdrop, this class will survey a number of different topics, including: health commodification; gift exchange; commodity chains; the history of money and debt; why objects have value; how people make ends meet; rational vs. non-rational decision-making; behavioral economic experiments conducted in other cultures; development economics, and why some objects and services have prices while others do not.
